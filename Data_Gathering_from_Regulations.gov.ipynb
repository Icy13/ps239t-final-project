The Dodd-Frank Act\\n\\n    On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act\\'\\').\\\\1\\\\ Title VII \\nof the Dodd-Frank Act \\\\2\\\\ amended the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA\\'\\') \\n\\\\3\\\\ to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for swaps and \\nsecurity-based swaps. This legislation was enacted to reduce risk, \\nincrease transparency and promote market integrity within the financial \\nsystem by, inter alia: (1) Providing for the registration and \\ncomprehensive regulation of swap dealers (``SDs\\'\\') and major swap \\nparticipants (``MSPs\\'\\'); (2) imposing mandatory clearing and trade \\nexecution requirements on standardized derivative products; (3) \\ncreating robust recordkeeping and real-time reporting regimes; and (4) \\nenhancing the Commission\\'s rulemaking and enforcement authorities with \\nrespect to, among others, all registered entities and intermediaries \\nsubject to the Commission\\'s oversight.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\1\\\\ See Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).\\n    \\\\2\\\\ The short title of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act is the \\n``Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010.\\'\\'\\n    \\\\3\\\\ See 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section 727 of the Dodd-Frank Act created section 2(a)(13) of the \\nCEA, which authorizes and requires the Commission to promulgate \\nregulations for the real-time public reporting of swap transaction and \\npricing data.\\\\4\\\\ Section 2(a)(13)(A) provides that ``real-time public \\nreporting\\'\\' means reporting ``data relating to a swap transaction, \\nincluding price and volume, as soon as technologically practicable \\nafter the time at which the swap transaction has been executed.\\'\\' \\\\5\\\\ \\nSection 2(a)(13)(B) states that the purpose of section 2(a)(13) is ``to \\nauthorize the Commission to make swap transaction and pricing data \\navailable to the public in such form and at such times as the \\nCommission determines appropriate to enhance price discovery.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\4\\\\ See generally CEA section 2(a)(13), 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(13).\\n    \\\\5\\\\ CEA section 2(a)(13)(A).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In general, section 2(a)(13) of the CEA directs the Commission to \\nprescribe regulations providing for the public availability of \\ntransaction and pricing data for certain swaps. Section 2(a)(13) places \\ntwo other statutory requirements on the Commission that are relevant to \\nthis final rule. First, sections 2(a)(13)(E)(ii) and (iii) of the CEA \\nrespectively require the Commission to prescribe regulations specifying \\n``the criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional swap \\ntransaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts\\'\\' and \\n``the appropriate time delay for reporting large notional swap \\ntransactions (block trades) to the public.\\'\\' \\\\6\\\\ In promulgating \\nregulations under section 2(a)(13), section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv) directs the \\nCommission to take into account whether public disclosure of swap \\ntransaction and pricing data ``will materially reduce market \\nliquidity.\\'\\' \\\\7\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\6\\\\ Section 2(a)(13)(E) explicitly refers to the swaps described \\nonly in sections 2(a)(13)(C)(i) and 2(a)(13)(C)(ii) of the CEA \\n(i.e., clearable swaps, including swaps that are exempt from \\nclearing). As noted in the Commission\\'s Initial Proposal (as defined \\nbelow), its Real-Time Reporting Final Rule (as defined below), and \\nits Further Block Proposal (as defined below), the Commission, in \\nexercising its authority under CEA section 2(a)(13)(B) to ``make \\nswap transaction and pricing data available to the public in such \\nform and at such times as the Commission determines appropriate to \\nenhance price discovery,\\'\\' is authorized to prescribe rules similar \\nto those provisions in section 2(a)(13)(E) to uncleared swaps \\ndescribed in section 2(a)(13)(C)(iii) and (iv) of the CEA.\\n    \\\\7\\\\ CEA section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv). Section 5h(f)(2)(C) of the CEA \\nimposes a similar directive upon registered swap execution \\nfacilities (``SEF\\'\\') by requiring that they set forth rules for \\nblock trades for swap execution purposes.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The second statutory requirement relevant to this final rule is \\nfound in sections 2(a)(13)(E)(i) and 2(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the CEA. \\nThrough these sections, Congress sought to ``ensure that the public \\nreporting of swap transaction and pricing data [would] not disclose the \\nnames or identities of the parties to [swap] transactions.\\'\\' \\\\8\\\\ \\nAccordingly, Sec.  2(a)(13)(E)(i) of the CEA requires the Commission to \\nprotect the identities of counterparties to mandatorily-cleared swaps, \\nswaps excepted from the mandatory clearing requirement, and \\nvoluntarily-cleared swaps.

The Initial Proposal\\n\\n1. Overview\\n    On December 7, 2010, the Commission published in the Federal \\nRegister a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement section 2(a)(13) \\nof the CEA, which included specific provisions pursuant to sections \\n2(a)(13)(E)(i)-(iv) and 2(a)(13)(C)(iii).\\\\11\\\\ In this Initial Proposal, \\nthe Commission set out proposed provisions to satisfy, among other \\nthings, the statutory requirements discussed above regarding minimum \\nblock sizes and anonymity protections. With respect to the first \\nstatutory requirement, the Commission proposed: (1) Definitions for the \\nterms ``large notional off-facility swap\\'\\' and ``block trade\\'\\'; \\\\12\\\\ \\n(2) a method for determining the appropriate minimum block sizes for \\nlarge notional off-facility swaps and block trades; \\\\13\\\\ and (3) a \\nframework for timely reporting of such transactions and trades.\\\\14\\\\ \\nProposed Sec.  43.5(g) provided that registered swap data repositories \\n(``SDRs\\'\\') would be responsible for calculating the appropriate minimum \\nblock size for each ``swap instrument\\'\\' using the greater result of the \\ndistribution test \\\\15\\\\ and the multiple test.\\\\16\\\\ Proposed Sec.  \\n43.2(y) broadly defined ``swap instrument\\'\\' as ``a grouping of swaps in \\nthe same asset class with the same or similar characteristics.\\'\\'\\\\17\\\\ \\nProposed Sec.  43.5(h) provided that for any swap listed on a swap \\nexecution facility (``SEF\\'\\') or designated contract market (``DCM\\'\\'), \\nthe SEF or DCM must set the appropriate minimum block trade size at a \\nlevel at or above that established by an SDR for the relevant swap \\ninstrument.\\\\18\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\11\\\\ See Real-Time Public Reporting of Swap Transaction Data, 75 \\nFR 76139, Dec. 7, 2010, as corrected in Real-Time Public Reporting \\nof Swap Transaction Data Correction, 75 FR 76930, Dec. 10, 2010. \\nInterested persons are directed to the Initial Proposal for a full \\ndiscussion of each of the proposed part 43 rules.\\n    \\\\12\\\\ The Initial Proposal defined the term ``large notional \\nswap.\\'\\' See proposed Sec.  43.2(l), 75 FR 76171. The Real-Time \\nReporting Final Rule finalized the term as ``large notional off-\\nfacility swap,\\'\\' to denote, in relevant part, that the swap is not \\nexecuted pursuant to a SEF or designated contract market\\'s (``DCM\\'\\') \\nrules and procedures. See Sec.  43.2, 77 FR 1182, 1244, Jan. 9, \\n2012. Specifically, the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule defined the \\nterm as an ``off-facility swap that has a notional or principal \\namount at or above the appropriate minimum block size applicable to \\nsuch publicly reportable swap transaction and is not a block trade \\nas defined in Sec.  43.2 of the Commission\\'s regulations.\\'\\' Id. \\nThroughout this final rulemaking, the Commission uses the term \\n``large notional off-facility swap\\'\\' as adopted in the Real-Time \\nReporting Final Rule.\\n    The Initial Proposal\\'s definition of ``block trade\\'\\' was similar \\nto the final definition in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule. See \\nproposed Sec.  43.2(f), 75 FR 76171. The Real-Time Reporting Final \\nRule defines the term ``block trade\\'\\' as a publicly reportable swap \\ntransaction that: ``(1) [i]nvolves a swap that is listed on a SEF or \\nDCM; (2) [o]ccurs away from the [SEF\\'s or DCM\\'s] trading system or \\nplatform and is executed pursuant to the [SEF\\'s or DCM\\'s] rules and \\nprocedures; (3) has a notional or principal amount at or above the \\nappropriate minimum block applicable to such swap; and (4) [i]s \\nreported subject to the rules and procedures of the [SEF or DCM] and \\nthe rules described in [part 43], including the appropriate time \\ndelay requirements set forth in Sec.  43.5.\\'\\' See Sec.  43.2, 77 FR \\n1243.\\n    \\\\13\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.5, 75 FR 76174-76.\\n    \\\\14\\\\ Proposed Sec.  43.5(k)(1) in the Initial Proposal provided \\nthat the time delay for the public dissemination of data for a block \\ntrade or large notional off-facility swap shall commence at the time \\nof execution of such trade or swap. See 75 FR 76176. Proposed Sec.  \\n43.5(k)(2) provided that the time delay for standardized block \\ntrades and large notional off-facility swaps (i.e., swaps that fall \\nunder CEA Section 2(a)(13)(C)(i) and (iv)) would be 15 minutes from \\nthe time of execution. Id. The Initial Proposal did not provide \\nspecific time delays for large notional off-facility swaps (i.e., \\nswaps that fall under Section 2(a)(13)(C)(ii) and (iii)). Instead, \\nproposed Sec.  43.5(k)(3) provided that the time delay for such \\nswaps shall be reported subject to a time delay that may be \\nprescribed by the Commission. Id.\\n    The Real-Time Reporting Final Rule established time delays for \\nthe public dissemination of block trades and large notional off-\\nfacility swaps in Sec.  43.5. See 77 FR 1247-49.\\n    \\\\15\\\\ The distribution test, described in proposed Sec.  \\n43.5(g)(1)(i) of the Initial Proposal, required that an SDR take the \\nrounded transaction sizes of all trades executed over a period of \\ntime for a particular swap instrument and create a distribution of \\nthose trades. An SDR would then determine the minimum threshold \\namount as an amount that is greater than 95 percent of the notional \\nor principal transaction sizes for the swap instrument for an \\napplicable period of time. See 75 FR 76175.\\n    \\\\16\\\\ The multiple test, described in proposed Sec.  \\n43.5(g)(1)(ii) in the Initial Proposal, required that an SDR \\nmultiply the block trade multiple by the ``social size\\'\\' of a \\nparticular swap instrument. Proposed Sec.  43.2(x) defined ``social \\nsize\\'\\' as the greatest of the mean, median or mode transaction size \\nfor a particular swap instrument. The Commission proposed a block \\ntrade multiple of five. Id.\\n    \\\\17\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.2(y), 75 FR 76172.\\n    \\\\18\\\\ See 75 FR 76176.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    With respect to anonymity, the Initial Proposal set forth several \\nprovisions to address issues pertinent to protecting the identities of \\nparties to a swap. Essentially, these proposed provisions sought to \\nprotect the identities of parties to a swap through the limited \\ndisclosure of information and data relevant to the swap. In particular, \\nproposed Sec.  43.4(e)(1) in the Initial Proposal provided that an SDR \\ncould not publicly report swap transaction and pricing data in a manner \\nthat discloses or otherwise facilitates the identification of a party \\nto a swap. Proposed Sec.  43.4(e)(2) would have placed a requirement on \\nSEFs, DCMs and reporting parties to provide an SDR with a specific \\ndescription of the underlying asset and tenor of a swap. This proposed \\nsection also included a qualification with respect to the reporting of \\nthe specific description. In particular, this section provided that \\n``[the] description must be general enough to provide anonymity but \\nspecific enough to provide for a meaningful understanding of the \\neconomic characteristics of the swap.\\'\\' \\\\19\\\\ This qualification would \\nhave applied to all swaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\19\\\\ See 75 FR 76174.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the Initial Proposal, the Commission acknowledged that swaps \\nthat are executed on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM do not \\nraise the same level of concerns in protecting the identities, business \\ntransactions or market positions of swap counterparties since these \\nswaps generally lack customization.\\\\20\\\\ As a result, the Commission \\nprovided that SEFs and DCMs should tailor the description required by \\nproposed Sec.  43.2(e) depending on the asset class and place of \\nexecution of each swap.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\20\\\\ See 75 FR 76151 (``In contrast, for those swaps that are \\nexecuted on a swap market, the Commission believes that since such \\ncontracts will be listed on a particular trading platform or \\nfacility, it will be unlikely that a party to a swap could be \\ninferred based on the reporting of the underlying asset and \\ntherefore parties to swaps executed on swap markets must report the \\nspecific underlying assets and tenor of the swap.\\'\\').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In contrast, the Commission acknowledged that the public \\ndissemination of a description of the specific underlying asset and \\ntenor of swaps that are not executed on or pursuant to the rules of a \\nSEF or DCM (i.e., swaps that are executed bilaterally) may result in \\nthe unintended disclosure of the identities, business transactions or \\nmarket positions of swap counterparties, particularly for swaps in the \\nother commodity asset class.\\\\21\\\\ To address this issue, the Commission \\nproposed in Sec.  43.4(e)(2) that an SDR publicly disseminate a more \\ngeneral description of the specific underlying asset and tenor.\\\\22\\\\ In \\nthe Initial Proposal, the Commission provided a hypothetical example of \\nhow an SDR could mask or otherwise protect the underlying asset from \\npublic disclosure\\n\\n[[Page 32869]]\\n\\nin a manner too specific so as to divulge the identity of a swap \\ncounterparty. The Commission, however, did not set forth a specific \\nmanner in which SDRs should carry out this requirement.\\\\23\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\21\\\\ See 75 FR 76150-51.\\n    \\\\22\\\\ See 75 FR 76174.\\n    \\\\23\\\\ See 75 FR 76150. The Initial Proposal further provided that \\nthe requirement in proposed Sec.  43.4(e)(2) was separate from the \\nrequirement that a reporting party report swap data to an SDR \\npursuant to section 2(a)(13)(G) of the CEA. See 75 FR 76174.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To further protect the identities, business transactions or market \\npositions of swap counterparties, proposed Sec.  43.4(i) of the Initial \\nProposal included a rounding convention for all swaps, which included a \\n``notional cap\\'\\' provision. The proposed notional cap provision \\nprovided, for example, that if the notional size of a swap is greater \\nthan $250 million, then an SDR only would publicly disseminate a \\nnotation of ``$250+\\'\\' rather than the actual notional size of the \\nswap.\\\\24\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\24\\\\ See 75 FR 76152.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission issued the Initial Proposal for public comment for a \\nperiod of 60 days, but later reopened the comment period for an \\nadditional 45 days.\\\\25\\\\ After issuing the Initial Proposal, the \\nCommission received 105 comment letters and held 40 meetings with \\ninterested parties regarding the proposed provisions.\\\\26\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\25\\\\ The initial comment period for the Initial Proposal closed \\non February 7, 2011. The comment periods for most proposed \\nrulemakings implementing the Dodd-Frank Act--including the proposed \\npart 43 rules--subsequently were reopened for the period of April 27 \\nthrough June 2, 2011.\\n    \\\\26\\\\ The interested parties who either submitted comment letters \\nor met with Commission staff included end-users, potential swap \\ndealers, asset managers, industry groups/associations, potential \\nSDRs, a potential SEF, multiple law firms on behalf of their clients \\nand a DCM. Of the 105 comment letters submitted in response to the \\nInitial Proposal, 42 letters focused on various issues relating to \\nblock trades and large notional off-facility swaps. Of the 40 \\nmeetings, five meetings focused on various issues relating to block \\ntrades and large notional off-facility swaps.

Public Comments in Response to the Initial Proposal\\n    The commenters to the Initial Proposal provided general and \\nspecific comments relating to the proposed provisions regarding the \\ndetermination of appropriate minimum block sizes and anonymity \\nprotections for the identities, business transactions and market \\npositions of swap counterparties.\\\\27\\\\ The comments submitted regarding \\nthe Initial Proposal\\'s provisions regarding appropriate minimum block \\nsizes and anonymity protections are summarized in detail in the Further \\nBlock Proposal.\\\\28\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\27\\\\ A list of the full names and abbreviations of commenters \\nwho responded to the Initial Proposal and who the Commission refers \\nto in the Further Block Proposal is included in section VI below.

Issuance of the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule\\n\\n    In consideration of the public comments submitted in response to \\nthe Initial Proposal, the Commission obtained and analyzed swap data in \\norder to better understand the trading activity of swaps in certain \\nasset classes.\\\\30\\\\ The Commission also reviewed additional information, \\nincluding a study pertaining to the mandatory trade execution \\nrequirement and post-trade transparency concerns that arose out of two \\nof the Commission\\'s proposed rulemakings,\\\\31\\\\ as well as a report \\nissued by two industry trade associations on block trade reporting in \\nthe swaps market.\\\\32\\\\ In addition, the Commission and the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission (``SEC\\'\\') held a two-day public roundtable on \\nDodd-Frank Act implementation on May 2-3, 2011 (``Public \\nRoundtable\\'\\').\\\\33\\\\ During the Public Roundtable and in comment letters \\nsubmitted in support thereof, interested parties recommended that the \\nCommission adopt a phased-in approach with respect to establishing \\nblock trade rules.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\30\\\\ A detailed discussion of Commission staff\\'s review and \\nanalysis process is set out below in sections II.A.1.b.i. and c.i.\\n    \\\\31\\\\ See ISDA, Costs and Benefits of Mandatory Electronic \\nExecution Requirements for Interest Rate Products, 24 (ISDA \\nDiscussion Paper No. 2, Nov. 2011), available at <a href=\"http://www2.isda.org/attachment/Mzc0NA==/ISDA%20Mandatory%20Electronic%20Execution%20Discussion%20Paper.pdf\">http://www2.isda.org/attachment/Mzc0NA==/ISDA%20Mandatory%20Electronic%20Execution%20Discussion%20Paper.pdf</a>. \\nThis paper cited the Commission\\'s notice of proposed rulemaking with \\nrespect to SEFs (Core Principles and Other Requirements for Swap \\nExecution Facilities, 76 FR 1214, 1220, Jan. 7, 2011) and the \\nInitial Proposal.\\n    \\\\32\\\\ See ISDA and SIFMA, Block trade reporting over-the-counter \\nderivatives markets, 6 (Jan. 2011), available at <a href=\"http://www.isda.org/speeches/pdf/Block-Trade-Reporting.pdf\">http://www.isda.org/speeches/pdf/Block-Trade-Reporting.pdf</a>.\\n    \\\\33\\\\ See Joint Public Roundtable on Issues Related to the \\nSchedule for Implementing Final Rules for Swaps and Security-Based \\nSwaps Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \\nProtection Act, 76 FR 23211, Apr. 26, 2011.

As noted above, the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule \\ndid not define the term swap instrument. This final rule adopts a \\nnew term, swap category, which groups swaps for the purpose of \\ndetermining whether a swap transaction qualifies as a large notional \\noff-facility swap or block trade. See note 17 supra.\\n    \\\\36\\\\ See Sec.  43.2 of the Commission\\'s regulations. 77 FR 1244. \\nThe Real-Time Reporting Final Rule finalized the definition of \\n``reporting party\\'\\' as a ``party to a swap with the duty to report a \\npublicly reportable swap transaction in accordance with this part \\n[43] and section 2(a)(13)(F) of the [CEA].\\'\\' 77 FR 1244.\\n    \\\\37\\\\ See 77 FR 1244.\\n    \\\\38\\\\ See 77 FR 1185.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nD. Further Block Proposal\\n\\n    On March 15, 2012, the Commission issued for comment the Further \\nBlock Proposal.\\\\39\\\\ Based on the public comments received in response \\nto the Initial Proposal, and in order to successfully implement the \\nreal-time public reporting regulatory framework\\n\\n[[Page 32870]]\\n\\nestablished in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission \\nproposed provisions in the Further Block Proposal that: (1) Specify the \\ncriteria for determining swap categories and methodologies for \\ndetermining the appropriate minimum block sizes for large notional off-\\nfacility swaps and block trades; and (2) provide increased protections \\nto the identities of swap counterparties to large swap transactions and \\ncertain other commodity swaps, which were not fully addressed in the \\nReal-Time Reporting Final Rule.\\\\40\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\39\\\\ See 77 FR 15460.\\n    \\\\40\\\\ In several places in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, \\nthe Commission stated that it planned to address these requirements \\nin a separate, forthcoming release. See, e.g., 77 FR 1185, 1191, \\n1193 and 1217. The Further Block Proposal was that release.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Policy Goals\\n    In section 2(a)(13) of the CEA, Congress intended that the \\nCommission consider both the benefits of enhanced market transparency \\nand the effects such transparency would have on market liquidity.\\\\41\\\\ \\nSection 2(a)(13)(E)(iv) of the CEA places constraints on the \\nrequirements for the real-time public reporting of swap transaction and \\npricing data by mandating that the Commission shall ``take into account \\nwhether the public disclosure [of swap transaction and pricing data] \\nwill materially reduce market liquidity.\\'\\'\\\\42\\\\ While the Commission \\nanticipates that the public dissemination of swap transaction and \\npricing data will generally reduce costs associated with price \\ndiscovery and prevent information asymmetries between market makers and \\nend-users,\\\\43\\\\ it also believes that the benefits of enhanced market \\ntransparency are not boundless, particularly in swap markets with \\nlimited liquidity.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\41\\\\ In considering the benefits and effects of enhanced market \\ntransparency, the Commission notes that the ``guiding principle in \\nsetting appropriate block trade levels [is that] the vast majority \\nof swap transactions should be exposed to the public market through \\nexchange trading.\\'\\' Congressional Record--Senate, S5902, S5922 (July \\n15, 2010).\\n    \\\\42\\\\ CEA section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv). See also CEA section \\n5h(f)(2)(C) (concerning the treatment of block trades on SEFs for \\ntrade execution purposes).\\n    \\\\43\\\\ See e.g., CEA section 2(a)(13)(B) (``The purpose of this \\nsection is to authorize the Commission to make swap transaction and \\npricing data available to the public in such form and at such times \\nas the Commission determines appropriate to enhance price \\ndiscovery.\\'\\').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission understands that the publication of detailed \\ninformation regarding ``outsize swap transactions\\'\\' \\\\44\\\\ could expose \\nswap counterparties to higher trading costs.\\\\45\\\\ In this regard, the \\npublication of detailed information about an outsize swap transaction \\nmay alert the market to the possibility that the original liquidity \\nprovider to the outsize swap transaction will be re-entering the market \\nto offset that transaction.\\\\46\\\\ Other market participants might be \\nalerted to the liquidity provider\\'s need to offset risk and therefore \\nwould have a strong incentive to exact a premium from the liquidity \\nprovider. As a result, liquidity providers possibly could be deterred \\nfrom becoming counterparties to outsize swap transactions if swap \\ntransaction and pricing data is publicly disseminated before liquidity \\nproviders can offset their positions. The Commission anticipates that, \\nin turn, this result could negatively affect liquidity in the swaps \\nmarket.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\44\\\\ As used in the Further Block Proposal and this final rule, \\nan ``outsize swap transaction\\'\\' is a transaction that, as a function \\nof its size and the depth of the liquidity of the relevant market \\n(and equivalent markets), leaves one or both parties to such \\ntransaction unlikely to transact at a competitive price.\\n    \\\\45\\\\ Consistent with this final rule, the Commission clarified \\nin the SEF final rule that a swap transaction qualifies as a block \\ntrade based on the size of the swap transaction, not based on \\nwhether the swap is subject to the trade execution requirement under \\nsection 2(h)(8) of the CEA. See Core Principles and Other \\nRequirements for Swap Execution Facilities, p. 72 (May 16, 2013)]. \\nIn Sec.  37.200 of the Commission\\'s regulations, the Commission has \\ncodified the statutory text of SEF Core Principle 2 under section \\n5h(f)(2)(C) of the CEA, which requires a SEF to establish rules \\ngoverning the operation of its trading facility, including trading \\nprocedures for block trades. 17 CFR 37.200(c). Similarly, the \\nCommission\\'s proposed rulemaking regarding core principles and other \\nrequirements for DCMs under Sec.  38.504 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations, the Commission requires DCMs to adopt rules that comply \\nwith all of the provisions of part 43, including the block trade \\nprovisions finalized herein. Core Principles and Other Requirements \\nfor Designated Contract Markets, 75 FR 80572, 80617 (Dec. 22, 2010).\\n    \\\\46\\\\ The price of such a transaction would reflect market \\nconditions for the underlying commodity or reference index and the \\nliquidity premium for executing the swap transaction. The time \\ndelays in part 43 of the Commission\\'s regulations will protect end-\\nusers and liquidity providers from the expected price impact of the \\ndisclosure of publicly reportable swap transactions. Trading that \\nexploits the need of traders to reduce or offset their positions has \\nbeen defined in financial economics literature as ``predatory \\ntrading.\\'\\' See e.g., Markus Brunnermeier and Lasse Heje Pedersen, \\nPredatory Trading, Journal of Finance LX 4, Aug. 2005, available at \\nhttp://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/predatory_trading.pdf.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In consideration of these potential outcomes, the Further Block \\nProposal sought to provide maximum public transparency, while taking \\ninto account the concerns of liquidity providers regarding possible \\nreductions in market liquidity. To do so, the Further Block Proposal \\nestablished the following more detailed criteria: (1) Swap categories \\n(relative to the definition of swap instrument in the Initial \\nProposal); (2) a phased-in approach to determining appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes for block trades and large notional off-facility swaps; and \\n(3) anonymity provisions for the public reporting of transaction data. \\nA summary of the Commission\\'s proposed approach is provided below.\\n2. Summary of Proposed Approach\\n    The Commission proposed a two-period, phased-in approach to \\nimplement regulations for determining appropriate minimum block \\nsizes.\\\\47\\\\ Specifically, the Commission proposed phasing-in minimum \\nblock sizes during an initial period and setting them thereafter on an \\nongoing basis (i.e., the post-initial period) so that market \\nparticipants could better adjust their swap trading strategies to \\nmanage risk, secure new technologies and make necessary arrangements in \\norder to comply with part 43 reporting requirements. The Commission \\nproposed two provisions relating to the Commission\\'s determination of \\nappropriate minimum block sizes: (1) Initial appropriate minimum block \\nsizes under proposed Sec.  43.6(e); and (2) post-initial appropriate \\nminimum block sizes under proposed Sec.  43.6(f).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\47\\\\ The Commission proposed the same phased-in approach for \\ndetermining cap sizes, which help to protect the anonymity of \\ncounterparties\\' market positions and business transactions as \\nrequired in the CEA. For a more detailed discussion of the \\nCommission\\'s proposed approach with respect to cap sizes, see \\nsection III.B.\\n    The two-period, phased-in approach would become effective after \\nthe implementation of the part 43 provisions in the Real-Time \\nReporting Final Rule. Until the date on which the proposed \\nprovisions in the Further Block Proposal become effective, all swaps \\nwould be subject to a time delay pursuant to the provisions in part \\n43.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In proposed Sec.  43.6(e), the Commission proposed establishing \\ninitial appropriate minimum block sizes for each category of swaps \\nwithin the interest rate, credit, foreign exchange (``FX\\'\\') and other \\ncommodity asset classes.\\\\48\\\\ The Commission listed the prescribed \\ninitial appropriate minimum block sizes in proposed appendix F to part \\n43 based on these swap categories.\\\\49\\\\ For interest rate and credit \\nswaps, the Commission reviewed actual market data and prescribed \\ninitial appropriate minimum block sizes for swap categories in these \\nasset classes\\n\\n[[Page 32871]]\\n\\nbased on that data. For the other asset classes, the Commission did not \\nhave access to relevant market data. As such, during the initial \\nperiod, the Commission proposed using a methodology based on whether a \\nswap or swap category is ``economically related\\'\\' to a futures \\ncontract.\\\\50\\\\ Swaps and swap categories that are not economically \\nrelated to a futures contract would remain subject to a time delay \\n(i.e., treated as block trades or large notional off-facility swaps, as \\napplicable, regardless of notional amount) during the initial period.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\48\\\\ The Commission proposed that swaps in the equity asset \\nclass do not qualify as block trades and large notional off-facility \\nswaps. See proposed Sec.  43.6(d). Otherwise, the Commission \\nproposed prescribing swap categories for each asset class as set \\nforth in proposed Sec.  43.6(b). These swap categories would remain \\nthe same during the initial and post-initial periods.\\n    \\\\49\\\\ The Commission notes SEFs and DCMs would not be prohibited \\nunder the Further Block Proposal from setting block sizes for swaps \\nat levels that are higher than the appropriate minimum block sizes \\nas determined by the Commission.\\n    \\\\50\\\\ See infra notes 169-174 and accompanying text.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In proposed Sec.  43.6(f)(1), the Commission provided that the \\nduration of this initial period would be no less than one year after an \\nSDR started collecting reliable data for a particular asset class as \\ndetermined by the Commission. During the initial period, the Commission \\nwould review reliable data for each asset class. For the purposes of \\nthis proposed provision, reliable data would include all data collected \\nby an SDR for each asset class in accordance with the compliance chart \\nin the adopting release to part 45 of the Commission\\'s regulations.\\\\51\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\51\\\\ See Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements, 77 \\nFR 2136, 2196, Jan. 13, 2012.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission stated in the Further Block Proposal and is \\ncurrently of the view that data is per se reliable if it is collected \\nby an SDR for an asset class after the respective compliance date for \\nsuch asset class as set forth in part 45 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations or by other Commission action. The Commission notes that \\nSDRs have been collecting data pursuant to the compliance dates for \\ncertain market participants and asset classes since December 2012.

In particular, in \\nproposed Sec.  43.6(d), the Commission prescribed special rules for \\nswaps in the equity asset class. In proposed Sec.  43.6(h), the \\nCommission proposed establishing special rules for determining \\nappropriate minimum block sizes in certain circumstances including, for \\nexample, rules for converting currencies and rules for determining \\nwhether a swap with optionality qualifies for block trade or large \\nnotional off-facility swap treatment.\\\\60\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\60\\\\ See infra Section II.B.6. for a discussion of the special \\nrules.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the Further Block Proposal\\'s proposed amendments to Sec.  \\n43.4(h) and 43.4(d)(4), the Commission also prescribed measures to \\nfulfill the CEA\\'s anonymity requirements in connection with the public \\ndissemination of publicly reportable swap transactions. The Commission \\nproposed adopting the practices used by most federal agencies when \\nreleasing to the public company-specific information--by removing \\nobvious identifiers, limiting geographic detail (e.g., disclosing \\ngeneral, non-specific geographical information about the delivery and \\npricing points) and masking high-risk variables by truncating extreme \\nvalues for certain variables (e.g., capping notional values).\\\\61\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\61\\\\ The Commission proposed to follow the necessary procedures \\nfor releasing microdata files as outlined by the Federal Committee \\non Statistical Methodology: (i) Removal of all direct personal and \\ninstitutional identifiers, (ii) limiting geographic detail, and \\n(iii) top-coding high-risk variables which are continuous. See \\nFederal Committee on Statistical Methodology, Report on Statistical \\nDisclosure Limitation Methodology 94 (Statistical Policy Working \\nPaper 22, 2d ed. 2005), <a href=\"http://www.fcsm.gov/working-papers/totalreport.pdf\">http://www.fcsm.gov/working-papers/totalreport.pdf</a>. The report was originally prepared by the \\nSubcommittee on Disclosure Limitation Methodology in 1994 and was \\nrevised by the Confidentiality and Data Access Committee in 2005.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Overview of Comments Received\\n    The Commission received comments from 35 interested parties \\nrepresenting a broad range of interests including: financial end-users, \\nswap dealers, asset managers, industry groups/associations, potential \\nSEFs, and a DCM.\\\\62\\\\ Some commenters expressed general support for the \\nFurther Block Proposal\\'s provisions regarding minimum block sizes and \\nanonymity; others objected to particular aspects of the Further Block \\nProposal and/or offered recommendations for clarification or \\nmodification of specific proposed regulations.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\62\\\\ A list of the full names and abbreviations of commenters \\nwho responded to the Further Block Proposal is included in section \\nVIII below. As noted above, letters from these commenters and others \\nsubmitted in response to the Initial Proposal are available through \\nthe Commission\\'s Web site at <a href=\"http://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=919\">http://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=919</a>.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In addition to a general solicitation for comment on all aspects of \\nthe Further Block Proposal, the Commission requested comment on a \\nnumber of specific, focused questions related to particular provisions. \\nFor example, commenters were asked to address issues related to: (i) \\nThe appropriate criteria for determining swap categories in the five \\nasset classes; (ii) the appropriate methodology for determining \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for swaps in the five asset classes; \\n(iii) whether and how a phase-in of block thresholds should be \\nimplemented; (iv) special rules with respect to swaps with optionality, \\nswaps with composite reference prices, physical commodity swaps, \\ncurrency conversions, and successor currencies; (v) the role of SEFs \\nand DCMs in\\n\\n[[Page 32872]]\\n\\ndetermining appropriate minimum block sizes for swaps that they list; \\n(vi) the process by which the Commission would notify the public of \\nappropriate minimum block sizes; (vii) the process through which a \\nqualifying swap transaction would be treated as a block trade or large \\nnotional off-facility swap; (viii) the appropriate methodology for \\ndetermining the maximum limit of the principal, notional amount of a \\nswap that is publicly disseminated; (ix) appropriate anonymity \\nprotections for the public dissemination of publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions in the other commodity asset class.\\n    The Commission also requested comment with respect to the cost-\\nbenefit considerations in the Further Block Proposal and specifically \\nrequested commenters to provide a feasible alternative approach to \\nestablishing minimum block sizes that would impose less regulatory \\nburden on swap market participants and the general public. Commenters \\nalso were expressly invited to provide data regarding the direct and \\nindirect quantifiable costs with the proposed criteria for establishing \\nminimum block thresholds.\\n4. Additional Proposal Regarding Aggregation of Blocks\\n    Among the requirements contained in the Initial Proposal, proposed \\nSec.  43.5(b)(1) provided that eligible parties to a block trade (or \\nlarge notional swap) must be Eligible Contract Participants (``ECPs\\'\\'), \\nexcept that a DCM may allow a Commodity Trading Advisor (``CTA\\'\\'), \\ninvestment advisor, or foreign person meeting certain criteria to \\ntransact block trades for customers who are not ECPs. Further, proposed \\nSec.  43.5(m) prohibited aggregation of orders for different trading \\naccounts in order to satisfy the appropriate minimum block size \\nrequirement, except if done so on a DCM by a CTA, investment adviser, \\nor foreign person meeting certain criteria.\\n    After it issued its Further Block Proposal, the Commission \\ndetermined that the aggregation provision and the provision that \\nspecified the eligible parties to a block trade, including the proposed \\nrequirement that persons transacting block trades on behalf of \\ncustomers must receive prior written consent to do so, were \\ninadvertently omitted from the Further Block Proposal. These provisions \\nwere then the subject of a separate notice of proposed rulemaking \\nissued on June 27, 2012 (``Proposed Aggregation Rule\\'\\').\\\\63\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\63\\\\ Rules Prohibiting the Aggregation of Orders to Satisfy \\nMinimum Block Sizes or Cap Size Requirements, and Establishing \\nEligibility Requirements for Parties to Block Trades, 77 FR 38229, \\nJune 27, 2012.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received a total of nine comment letters in response \\nto the proposed rules regarding eligible parties to a block trade and \\naggregation of orders. Four of the letters responded to the Initial \\nProposal and five letters responded to the Proposed Aggregation Rule. \\nMany of the comments received applied equally to the same provisions \\ncontained in both proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(6) and 43.6(i), which address \\nthe aggregation of orders and the eligible parties to a block trade.\\n\\nII. Procedures To Establish Appropriate Minimum Block Sizes for Large \\nNotional Off-Facility Swaps and Block Trades--Final Rules\\n\\nA. Criteria for Distinguishing Among Swap Categories in Each Asset \\nClass\\n\\n    In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission proposed to use the \\nterm ``swap category\\'\\' to convey the concept of a grouping of swap \\ncontracts that would be subject to a common appropriate minimum block \\nsize.\\\\64\\\\ Specifically, the Commission proposed specific criteria for \\ndefining swap categories in each asset class. As adopted in the Real-\\nTime Reporting Final Rule, Sec.  43.2 of the Commission\\'s regulations \\ndefines ``asset class\\'\\' as ``a broad category of commodities, \\nincluding, without limitation, any `excluded commodity\\' as defined in \\nsection 1a(19) of the [CEA], with common characteristics underlying a \\nswap.\\'\\' \\\\65\\\\ Section 43.2 also identifies the following five swap asset \\nclasses: Interest rates; \\\\66\\\\ equity; credit; FX; \\\\67\\\\ and other \\ncommodities.\\\\68\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\64\\\\ Proposed Sec.  43.6(b) does not set out a definition for \\nthe term ``swap category.\\'\\' Instead, proposed Sec.  43.6(b) sets out \\nthe provisions that group swaps within each asset class with common \\nrisk and liquidity profiles, as determined by the Commission.\\n    \\\\65\\\\ See Sec.  43.2, 77 FR 1243.\\n    \\\\66\\\\ In the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission \\ndetermined that cross-currency swaps are a part of the interest rate \\nasset class. See 77 FR 1193. The Commission noted that this \\ndetermination is consistent with industry practice.\\n    \\\\67\\\\ The U.S. Department of the Treasury (``Treasury\\'\\') has \\nissued a Final Determination, pursuant to sections 1a(47)(E)(i) and \\n1b of the CEA, that exempts FX swaps and FX forwards from the \\ndefinition of ``swap\\'\\' under the CEA. Therefore, the requirements of \\nsection 2(a)(13) of the CEA would not apply to those transactions, \\nand such transactions would not be subject to part 43 of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations. See Determination of Foreign Exchange \\nSwaps and Foreign Exchange Forwards under the Commodity Exchange \\nAct, 77 FR 69694, Nov. 20, 2012. Nevertheless, section \\n1a(47)(E)(iii) of the CEA provides that FX swaps and FX forwards \\ntransactions still are not excluded from regulatory reporting \\nrequirements to an SDR. Further, the Commission notes that \\nTreasury\\'s final determination excludes FX swaps and FX forwards, \\nbut does not apply to FX options or non-deliverable FX forwards. As \\nsuch, FX instruments that are not covered by Treasury\\'s final \\ndetermination are subject to part 43 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations.\\n    \\\\68\\\\ The Real-Time Reporting Final Rule defines the term ``other \\ncommodity\\'\\' to mean any commodity that is not categorized in the \\nother asset classes as may be determined by the Commission. See 77 \\nFR 1244. The definition of asset class in Sec.  43.2 also provides \\nthat the Commission may later determine that there are other asset \\nclasses not identified currently in that section. See 77 FR 1243.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The proposed swap category criteria are intended to address the \\nfollowing two policy objectives: (1) Categorizing together swaps with \\nsimilar quantitative or qualitative characteristics that warrant being \\nsubject to the same appropriate minimum block size; and (2) minimizing \\nthe number of the swap categories within an asset class in order to \\navoid unnecessary complexity in the determination process.\\\\69\\\\ In the \\nCommission\\'s view, balancing these policy objectives and considering \\nthe characteristics of different types of swaps within an asset class \\nare necessary in establishing appropriate criteria for determining swap \\ncategories within each asset class. The five asset classes established \\nby the Commission in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule are discussed \\nbriefly in the paragraph below, followed by a discussion of the \\nproposed swap category criteria for each asset class.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\69\\\\ These objectives are specific to the determination of \\nappropriate swap category criteria and are intended to promote the \\ngeneral policy goals described above in section I.D.1.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission proposed breaking \\ndown each asset class into separate swap categories to determine \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for such categories. During the initial \\nand post-initial periods, the Commission would group swaps in the five \\nasset classes into the prescribed swap categories as set forth in \\nproposed Sec.  43.6(b).\\n\\n[[Page 32873]]\\n\\n    Twenty-one commenters addressed the Further Block Proposal\\'s use of \\nswap categories.\\\\70\\\\ The vast majority of the comments did not question \\nthe use of swap categories generally, and focused on the specific \\ncriteria proposed for determining swap categories within each asset \\nclass instead. Better Markets and ICI expressly supported the \\nCommission\\'s proposed use of swap categories.\\\\71\\\\ Better Markets stated \\nthat ``the concept of a `swap category\\' is useful, in that it allows \\ngreater granularity than the far broader notion of `asset class.\\' \\'\\' \\n\\\\72\\\\ ICI ``support[ed] the CFTC\\'s proposal to establish categories of \\nswaps within different asset classes that would be subject to a common \\nappropriate minimum block size to better calibrate the block thresholds \\nto the relative liquidity of the swap categories in each asset class.\\'\\' \\n\\\\73\\\\ ICAP, however, disagreed with the Commission\\'s use of swap \\ncategories and stated that ``the Commission\\'s proposal is mistaken in \\nits use of `swap categories\\' . . . as opposed to using the standard \\nliquid tenors of swap contracts.\\'\\' \\\\74\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\70\\\\ See generally CL-AFR; CL-AII; CL-Barclays; CL-Better \\nMarkets; CL-CME; CL-FIA; CL-GFMA; CL-ICAP; CL-ICAP Energy; CL-ICI; \\nCL-ISDA/SIFMA; CL-Kinetix; CL-MFA; CL-Morgan Stanley; CL-\\nParascandola; CL-Parity; CL-Pierpont; CL-SDMA; CL-SIFMA; CL-WMBAA; \\nCL-Vanguard.\\n    \\\\71\\\\ CL-Better Markets at 5; CL-ICI at 4.\\n    \\\\72\\\\ CL-Better Markets at 5.\\n    \\\\73\\\\ CL-ICI at 4.\\n    \\\\74\\\\ CL-ICAP at 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments related to the use of swap \\ncategories, the Commission is adopting swap categories as proposed in \\nSec.  43.6, with certain modifications based upon both general concerns \\nexpressed by commenters in regard to the use of swap categories, \\nspecific concerns raised in regard to the criteria for determining swap \\ncategories within each asset class, and other relevant market \\ndevelopments.\\\\75\\\\ The following sections address the comments regarding \\nspecific asset classes and set out, where appropriate, the Commission\\'s \\nresponsive modifications of the swap categories approach.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\75\\\\ The Commission is using the term ``swap category\\'\\' instead \\nof ``swap instrument\\'\\' in this final rule. Although the Commission \\nis not adopting a definition of ``swap category,\\'\\' the Commission \\nbelieves that this term groups swap contracts that would be subject \\nto the same appropriate minimum block size based on asset class with \\ncommon quantitative or qualitative characteristics, i.e., risk and \\nliquidity profiles.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Interest Rate and Credit Asset Classes\\na. Background\\n    The Commission was able to obtain and review non-public swap data \\nto make inferences about patterns of trading activity, price impact and \\nliquidity in the markets for swaps in the interest rate and credit \\nasset classes. Based on that review, the Commission proposed criteria \\nfor determining swap categories in these two asset classes. \\nSpecifically, the Commission proposed defining swap categories for: (1) \\nInterest rate swaps based on unique combinations of tenor \\\\76\\\\ and \\ncurrency; and (2) credit default swaps (``CDS\\'\\') based on unique \\ncombinations of tenor and conventional spread.\\\\77\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\76\\\\ As used in the Further Block Proposal, the tenor of a swap \\nrefers to the amount of time from the effective or start date of a \\nswap to the end date of such swap. In circumstances where the \\neffective or start date of the swap was different from the trade \\ndate of the swap, the Commission used the later occurring of the two \\ndates to determine tenor.\\n    Two commenters addressed how the Commission should determine \\ntenor for backdated swaps. AFR stated that backdating a swap is the \\nequivalent of a swap with a date of its inception, but with a price \\nthat includes an adjustment for the backdating feature of the \\ntransaction; AFR wrote that tenor should be determined accordingly. \\nCL-AFR at 5-6. Similarly, ISDA/SIFMA requested that the Commission \\ndetermine the tenor of a back dated swap as the time from the date \\nof execution of the swap (as opposed to the start date) to the \\nmaturity date of the swap. CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 10. After consideration \\nof these comments, the Commission maintains the same approach from \\nthe Further Block Proposal.\\n    \\\\77\\\\ As generally used in the industry, the term ``conventional \\nspread\\'\\' represents the equivalent of a swap dealer\\'s quoted spread \\n(i.e., an upfront fee based on a fixed coupon and using standard \\nassumptions such as auctions and recovery rates). More information \\nregarding the use of this term can be found at Markit, The CDS Big \\nBang: Understanding the Changes to the Global CDS Contract and North \\nAmerican Conventions, at <a href=\"http://www.markit.com/cds/announcements/resource/cds_big_bang.pdf\">http://www.markit.com/cds/announcements/resource/cds_big_bang.pdf</a>, (Mar. 2009), at 19.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission obtained transaction-level data for these asset \\nclasses from two third-party service providers with the assistance of \\nthe Over-the-Counter Derivatives Supervisors Group (``ODSG\\'\\').\\\\78\\\\ \\nEstablished in 2005, the ODSG is chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank of \\nNew York and is comprised of domestic and international supervisors of \\nrepresentatives from major OTC derivatives market participants.\\\\79\\\\ In \\nparticular, the ODSG coordinated with the ``G-14 banks\\'\\' in order to \\ngain written permission to access the non-public swap data.\\\\80\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\78\\\\ Section 8(a) of the CEA protects non-public, transaction-\\nlevel data from public disclosure. Section 8(a)(1) provides, in \\nrelevant part, that ``the Commission may not publish data and \\ninformation that would separately disclose the business transactions \\nor market positions of any person and trade secrets or names of \\ncustomers . . . .\\'\\' To assist commenters, the Further Block Proposal \\nincluded various tables and summary statistics depicting the ODSG \\ndata in aggregate forms. In the discussion that follows, the \\nCommission additionally has described the methodology it employed in \\nreviewing, analyzing and drawing conclusions based on the ODSG data.\\n    \\\\79\\\\ See OTC Derivatives Supervisors Group--Federal Reserve Bank \\nof New York, <a href=\"http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/otc_derivatives_supervisors_group.html\">http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/otc_derivatives_supervisors_group.html</a> (last visited May 6, 2013). The ODSG was \\nformed ``in order to address the emerging risks of inadequate \\ninfrastructure for the rapidly growing market in the credit \\nderivatives . . . .\\'\\' The ODSG works directly with market \\nparticipants to plan, monitor and coordinate industry progress \\ntoward collective commitments made by firms.\\n    \\\\80\\\\ The G-14 banks are Bank of America-Merrill Lynch; Barclays \\nCapital; BNP Paribas; Citigroup; Credit Suisse; Deutsche Bank AG; \\nGoldman Sachs & Co.; HSBC Group; J.P. Morgan; Morgan Stanley; The \\nRoyal Bank of Scotland Group; Societe Generale; UBS AG; and Wells \\nFargo Bank, N.A.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    MarkitSERV \\\\81\\\\ provided the interest rate swap data set. The \\ninterest rate swap data set covered transactions confirmed on the \\nMarkitWire platform between June 1, 2010 and August 31, 2010 where at \\nleast one party was a G-14 Bank.\\\\82\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\81\\\\ MarkitSERV is a post-trade processing company wholly owned \\nby Markit. From its formation in 2009 until April 2013, MarkitSERV \\nwas jointly owned by Markit and The Depository Trust & Clearing \\nCorporation (``DTCC\\'\\').\\n    \\\\82\\\\ The interest rate swap data was limited to transactions and \\nevents submitted to the MarkitWire platform. MarkitWire is a trade \\nconfirmation service offered by MarkitSERV.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Warehouse Trust Company LLC (``The Warehouse Trust\\'\\') provided \\nthe CDS data set.\\\\83\\\\ The CDS data set covered CDS transactions for a \\nthree-month period beginning on May 1, 2010 and ending on July 31, \\n2010.\\\\84\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\83\\\\ The Warehouse Trust, a subsidiary of DTCC DerivSERV LLC, is \\nregulated as a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System and as a \\nlimited purpose trust company by the New York State Banking \\nDepartment.

See \\nKathryn Chen, et al., Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report, \\nAn Analysis of CDS Transactions: Implications for Public Reporting, \\n(Sept. 2011), at 25, <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr517.html\">http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr517.html</a>. The Commission notes that this allocation-level \\ninformation could produce a downward bias in the notional amounts of \\nthe swap transactions in the data sets provided by the ODSG. In \\nturn, this downward bias would produce smaller appropriate minimum \\nblock trade sizes relative to a data set that, if available with \\nappropriate execution time stamps, would reflect the aggregate \\nnotional amount of swaps completed in a single transaction.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission filtered both data sets in order to analyze only \\ntransaction-level data corresponding to ``publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions,\\'\\' as defined in Sec.  43.2 of the Real-Time\\n\\n[[Page 32874]]\\n\\nReporting Final Rule.\\\\85\\\\ As such, the Commission excluded from its \\nanalysis duplicate and non-price forming transactions.\\\\86\\\\ The \\nCommission also converted the notional amount of each swap transaction \\ninto a common currency denominator, the U.S. dollar.\\\\87\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\85\\\\ ``Publicly reportable swap transaction\\'\\' means, unless \\notherwise provided in part 43: (1) Any executed swap that is an \\narm\\'s-length transaction between two parties that results in a \\ncorresponding change in the market risk position between the two \\nparties; or (2) any termination, assignment, novation, exchange, \\ntransfer, amendment, conveyance, or extinguishing of rights or \\nobligations of a swap that changes the pricing of the swap. Examples \\nof an executed swap that do not fall within the definition of \\npublicly reportable swap transaction may include: (1) Certain \\ninternal swaps between 100-percent-owned subsidiaries of the same \\nparent entity; and (2) portfolio compression exercises. These \\nexamples represent swaps that are not transacted at arm\\'s length, \\nbut that do result in a corresponding change in the market risk \\nposition between two parties. See 77 FR 1244.\\n    \\\\86\\\\ The excluded records represented activities such as option \\nexercises or assignments for physical, risk optimization or \\ncompression transactions, and amendments or cancellations that were \\nassumed to be mis-confirmed. A transaction was assumed to be mis-\\nconfirmed when it was canceled without a fee, which the Commission \\nhas inferred was the result of a confirmation correction. The \\nCommission also excluded interest rate transactions that were \\nindicated as assignments, terminations, and structurally excluded \\nrecords since the Commission was unable to determine if these \\nrecords were price-forming. The Commission also excluded CDS \\ntransactions that were notated as single name transactions. The data \\nsets also included transaction records created for workflow purposes \\n(and therefore redundant), duplicates and transaction records \\nresulting from name changes or mergers.\\n    \\\\87\\\\ The Commission calculated the average daily exchange rates \\nbetween relevant currencies and the U.S. dollar for the three-month \\nperiod covered by the data. This average daily exchange rate was \\nthen applied to the notional amounts for non-U.S. dollar denominated \\nswap transactions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb.

   The Commission also analyzed the interest rate swap data set to \\nclassify the counterparties into broad groups.\\\\93\\\\ The Commission\\'s \\nanalysis of the interest rate swap data set revealed that approximately \\n50 percent of the transactions were between buyers and sellers who were \\nboth identified as G-14 banks and that these transactions represented a \\ncombined notional

Summary of Proposed Rule\\n    Based upon the data described above, the Commission proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(1) establishing swap categories in the interest rate asset \\nclass based on tenor and underlying currency.\\n    The Commission proposed interest rate swap tenor groupings based on \\ntwo observations regarding the data in the interest rate swap data set. \\nFirst, the Commission observed that points of concentrated transaction \\nactivity along the yield curve correspond with specific tenors (e.g., \\nthree months, six months, one year, two years, etc.). Second, the \\nCommission observed a tendency for the transacted notional amounts to \\ndecrease as tenor increased (e.g., longer-dated tenors in the data set \\ngenerally had lower average notional sizes). Based on these \\nobservations, table 3 below details the eight proposed tenor groups for \\nthe interest rate asset class.\\n\\n                       Table 3--Proposed Tenor Groups for Interest Rates Asset Class \\\\94\\\\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n             Tenor group                     Tenor greater than             And tenor less than or equal to\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1....................................  .............................

After \\nconsidering these factors, the Commission proposed three currency \\ncategories for the interest rate asset class: (1) Super-major \\ncurrencies, which are currencies with large volume and total notional \\namounts; \\\\96\\\\ (2) major currencies, which generally exhibit moderate \\nvolume and total notional amounts; \\\\97\\\\ and (3) non-major currencies, \\nwhich generally exhibit moderate to very low volume and total notional \\namounts.\\\\98\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\94\\\\ The Commission chose to extend the tenor groups about one-\\nhalf month beyond the commonly observed tenors to group similar \\ntenors together and capture variations in day counts. The Commission \\nadded an additional 15 days beyond a multiple of one year to the \\nnumber of days in each group to avoid ending each group on specific \\nyears.\\n    \\\\95\\\\ The Commission considered alternative approaches of using \\nthe individual floating rate indexes or currencies to determine swap \\ncategories in the interest rate asset class. These alternative \\napproaches would have the benefit of being more correlated to an \\nunderlying curve than the adopted currency and tenor groupings. The \\ndata contained 57 floating rate indexes and 28 currencies, which \\nwould result in 456 and 224 categories respectively, after sorting \\nby the eight identified tenor groups. The Commission anticipates, \\nhowever, that grouping swaps using individual rates or currencies \\nwould not substantially increase the explanation of variations in \\nnotional amounts, while it could result in cells with relatively few \\nobservations in some currency-tenor categories. Hence, the \\nCommission does not believe there would be a significant benefit to \\noffset the additional compliance burden that a more granular \\napproach would impose on market participants.\\n    \\\\96\\\\ Super-major currencies represent over 92 percent of the \\ntotal notional amounts and 80 percent of the total transactions in \\nthe data set. It is noteworthy that these currencies have well-\\ndeveloped, i.e., liquid futures markets for general interest rates \\nand FX rates.\\n    \\\\97\\\\ Major currencies represent about 6 percent of the total \\nnotional amount and about 10 percent of the total transactions in \\nthe data set.

In \\nthat report, Federal Reserve staff tested for a relationship between \\ntenor and trade size. The Federal Reserve staff identified nine tenor \\nbuckets, as opposed to the eight identified by the Commission. The \\ntenor buckets identified by the Federal Reserve staff were the same as \\nthose proposed by the Commission in the Further Block Proposal, with a \\nfurther division of the Commission\\'s 0-3 month bucket into a 0-1 month \\nbucket and a 1-3 month bucket.\\\\105\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\105\\\\ The Federal Reserve staff specifically found that ``when \\n[they] reduced the number of buckets at the short end of the trading \\ncurve (by merging the 0-1 month and 1-3 month buckets into a 0-3 \\nmonth bucket), the explanatory power of [their] regression declined \\n24%.\\'\\' Federal Reserve Staff Analysis at 16.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received and the Federal \\nReserve Staff Analysis, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(b)(1) \\nwith one modification--the addition of another tenor grouping at the \\nshorter end of the interest rate yield curve. The Commission notes, as \\nan initial matter, that commenters generally supported the use of tenor \\nbuckets to establish swap categories in the interest rate asset class. \\nCommenters, however, disagreed with the proposed tenor buckets.\\n    In the Further Block Proposal, tenor buckets were proposed based on \\nobservations of the distributions of notional sizes and volume with the \\nobjectives of grouping swaps with similar characteristics while \\nmaintaining a manageable number of swap categories. The tenor buckets \\nproposed by the Commission were associated with concentrations of \\nliquidity at commonly recognized points along the interest rate yield \\ncurve. In general, the Commission observed that transactions in the \\ndata set (and presumed market liquidity) tended to cluster at certain \\ntenors.\\n    In establishing the categories, the Commission proposed groupings \\nthat placed actively traded tenors at the upper boundary of the \\ncategory groupings because the calculation of the minimum block \\nthreshold in a category will be most influenced by the notional amounts \\nof the most heavily traded swaps in a category, i.e., those at the \\nactive tenor points. Hence, the minimum block thresholds for shorter \\ndated swaps in a category will tend to be set based on the typical \\nnotional value of longer dated swaps. Since the longer dated swaps tend \\nto trade in smaller notional amounts, establishing\\n\\n[[Page 32879]]\\n\\nthe categories in this manner will tend to result in a more \\nconservative (i.e., smaller) minimum block threshold for shorter \\ntenored swaps within the category. In addition, because the shorter-\\ndated swaps within an established swap category may experience less \\nliquidity, due to smaller trading volumes, these swaps may also benefit \\nfrom the setting of a lower minimum block threshold.\\n    The narrower tenor buckets recommended by commenters, in contrast, \\ntend to straddle the liquid tenor points. If the Commission were to \\nestablish tenor buckets straddling the liquid tenor points (rather than \\nhaving a liquid tenor point be the upper boundary of a tenor bucket), \\nthen the minimum block threshold for swaps within a category would be \\nmore heavily influenced by swaps centrally located in the category. \\nThus, longer dated swaps in a category, which tend to trade in smaller \\nnotional sizes, would be subject to higher minimum block thresholds, \\nmeaning fewer would be eligible for the block trade exemption.\\n    To illustrate the impact of placing the liquid tenor point at the \\ntop of the category, consider the impact on a seven-year interest rate \\nswap that is proposed to be grouped in a tenor bucket with swaps having \\na tenor greater than 5 years and less than or equal to 10 years. The \\nmost liquid tenor point (i.e., the tenor point with the greatest number \\nof observations) within this bucket would be the 10-year interest rate \\nswap; thus, the 10-year interest rate swap would be the primary driver \\nin determining the minimum block threshold for swaps in the 5 to 10-\\nyear tenor bucket. Table 7 is a subset of the information from Table 1 \\nthat illustrates this point. Specifically, there are 6,599 swaps with a \\ntenor of seven years, yielding an average notional amount of $100 \\nmillion (USD) and 34,000 swaps with a tenor of ten years yielding an \\naverage notional size of $81 million (USD). By combining these into the \\nsame category, the Commission is adopting a conservative approach in \\nsetting block sizes for the less liquid tenors.\\n    Under the commenters\\' approach, however, the seven-year interest \\nrate swap is grouped in the same tenor bucket with the 5-year tenor \\ninterest rate swaps. In this scenario, the liquid tenor point within \\nthe bucket is the 5-year interest rate swap; thus, the 5-year interest \\nrate swap, with more than 26,000 transactions yielding an average \\nnotional amount of $104 million (USD), is the primary driver in \\ndetermining the minimum block threshold for the tenor bucket and \\nresults in a larger block size for the 7-year tenor interest rate swaps \\nthan under the currently proposed swap category.\\n    The Commission is of the view that the tenor with the most \\ntransactions in the swap category, and thus having the most weight in \\nthe block calculations, should be at the high end of the tenor grouping \\nfor the swap category. Given the tendency for average notional size to \\ndecrease as tenor increases as shown in Table 7 below, the Commission \\nviews this as a more conservative approach to setting minimum block \\nthresholds, which results in lower block sizes for swap transactions at \\ntenors that may experience less liquidity.\\n\\n                 Table 7--Summary Statistics for the Interest Rate Swap Data Set by Tenor \\\\106\\\\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                                                               Average notional\\n                     Tenor \\\\107\\\\                           Number of        Notional amount    amount  (billions\\n                                                         transactions      (billions of USD)        of USD)\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1 Month.............................................               3,171              11,859               3.740\\n3 Month.............................................              10,229              11,660               1.140\\n6 Month.............................................               2,822               1,701               0.603\\n1 Year..............................................               9,522               3,484               0.366\\n2 Year..............................................              16,450               3,347               0.203\\n3 Year..............................................               9,628               1,488               0.155\\n5 Year..............................................              26,139               2,712               0.104\\n7 Year..............................................               6,599                 661               0.100\\n10 Year.............................................              34,000               2,746               0.081\\n30 Year.............................................               9,616                 448               0.047\\nOther...............................................              38,671               5,284               0.137\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n     \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\106\\\\ In producing Table 7, the Commission counted tenors for \\nswaps with an end date within four calendar days of a complete month \\nrelative to the swap\\'s start date as ending on the nearest complete \\nmonth.\\n    \\\\107\\\\ Tenor groups include swaps having tenors within 4 calendar \\ndays of a complete month, plus or minus, of the stated tenor.

While the Commission \\ndid not receive any comments specifically discussing the less than 46 \\nday tenor, the Commission received numerous comments recommending \\ngreater granularity. Based upon the comments received requesting nine \\ntenor buckets and the Federal Reserve Staff Analysis identifying nine \\ntenor buckets, the Commission has determined to add a less than 46 day \\ntenor group. This would provide greater granularity and establish \\nnotional swap groupings that account more precisely for the effects of \\nincreased transparency on liquidity for swaps of a shorter tenor.\\n    Accordingly, the Commission is adopting the following tenor \\nbuckets:\\n\\n[[Page 32880]]\\n\\n\\n\\n                           Table 8--Tenor Groups for Interest Rates Asset Class \\\\108\\\\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n             Tenor group                     Tenor greater than             And tenor less than or equal to\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1....................................  .............................  46 days.\\n2....................................  46 days......................

While ISDA/SIFMA \\nsupported separate categories for super-major currencies, their \\ncomment also suggests separate categorization for each individual \\ncurrency. Similarly, SIFMA\\'s comment, while requesting separate \\ncategorization generally, states that dividing the four proposed \\nsuper-major currencies is most important. CL-SIFMA at 8-9.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(b)(1)(i) as proposed in regard to currency \\ncategories. The currencies were grouped into the three categories in \\nthe Further Block Proposal based upon the swap transaction total \\nnotional amounts and transaction volumes of currency groups based on \\nthe number of transactions, and the average transaction notional \\namounts of currency groups. The commenters who requested that all \\ncurrencies be categorized by individual currency mainly focused on \\ndifferences in liquidity among the four super-major currencies, \\nparticularly when comparing interest rate swaps in USD and EUR to those \\nin JPY and GBP. Similarly, the commenters who specifically requested \\nthat the Commission establish separate swap categories for each of the \\nsuper-major currencies focused on perceived differences in liquidity. \\nWhile USD and EUR interest rate swaps feature the highest liquidity, \\nthe Commission is of the view that, based upon all of the criteria \\nmentioned above, the super-major currencies are most similar to each \\nother (and different from major \\\\112\\\\ and non-major currencies) to \\nwarrant treatment as a group, rather than separately.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\112\\\\ The Commission notes that the difference between the total \\nnotional and transactional volume of swaps referencing Japanese \\nyen--the lowest among those swaps in the super-major currency \\ncategory--and of swaps referencing the Australian Dollar--the \\nhighest among those swaps in the major currency category--is \\nsignificantly larger than such differences between swaps within each \\nadopted currency category. This observation supports adopting the \\nCommission\\'s approach in assigning certain swaps in the super-major \\ncurrency category against the major currency category.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission considered alternative approaches of using the \\nindividual currencies to determine swap categories in the interest rate \\nasset class. While these alternative approaches would have provided \\ngreater correlation to an underlying curve than the adopted groupings, \\nthe Commission believes that this would not substantially increase the \\nexplanation of variations in notional amounts, but rather would result \\nin categories with too few observations. Hence, the Commission does not \\nbelieve that there would be a significant benefit to offset the \\nadditional compliance burden that a more granular approach would impose \\non market participants. The Commission notes that adoption of the \\nproposed currency categories establishes 27 separate swap categories \\nfor interest rate swaps. Separate categorization of all currencies \\nwould result in nearly 200 separate swap categories. Separate \\ncategorization of the super-major currencies alone would result in 54 \\nswap categories. The Commission believes that the 27 separate swap \\ncategories contained in the rule achieves the objectives of grouping \\nswaps with similar characteristics while maintaining a manageable \\nnumber of swap categories.\\n    The Commission also received a number of comments recommending that \\ninterest rate swaps should be categorized based on criteria other than \\ntenor and currency. Four commenters suggested a range of additional \\ninterest rate swap categories for the purposes of establishing block \\nthresholds.\\\\113\\\\ Two other commenters suggested grouping swaps by \\nproduct type in addition to tenor and currency groupings.\\\\114\\\\ Another \\ncommenter, Kinetix, recommended grouping products by average trade \\nvolume, as well as by product type and tenor.\\\\115\\\\ Of the four \\ncommenters who expressed support for the proposed tenor and currency \\ngroupings,\\\\116\\\\ two of them argued that further granularity would cause \\nsome swaps to be subject to lower block thresholds than are \\nappropriate.\\\\117\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\113\\\\ Barclays suggested unique block levels for each of the \\nfollowing swap categories: each super major currency, swaps against \\nstandard floating rate indices, basis swaps, inflation swaps, \\nswaptions, caps and floors, cross-currency swaps, and structured \\nswaps. CL-Barclays at 7-8. ISDA/SIFMA suggested the following \\nadditional swap categories: fixed versus non-benchmark floating rate \\nindexes and basis swaps, inflation swaps (a specified inflation rate \\nindex), options (swaption and cap/floor markets); cross-currency \\nswaps (each leg denominated by different currency), and exotics. CL-\\nISDA/SIFMA at 9. SIFMA and Vanguard suggested swap categorization \\nbased on optionality or other characteristics such as distinctions \\nbetween ``plain vanilla,\\'\\' ``interest rate options,\\'\\' and ``other,\\'\\' \\nas well as separate categories for major floating rate indices.

Although some level of\\n\\n[[Page 32881]]\\n\\ncategorization of swaps is useful to capture different levels of \\ntrading activity and hedging potential, where a number of different \\nswaps could be used to hedge the same risk, the over-identification of \\nswap categories will eventually lead to a dilution of observations \\nwithin categories. Categories having small numbers of observations \\ncould be subject to highly volatile minimum block sizes over time. \\nOver-identification also would be expected to lead to underestimations \\nof the ability to offset risks using related swap instruments. The \\nCommission believes that it has struck a balance between over- and \\nunder-categorizing swaps that will result in more stable minimum block \\nsizes and allow for adequate risk offsets using instruments within a \\ncategory. The modification described above in regard to tenor will \\nprovide some further granularity at the short end of the yield curve, \\nas suggested by commenters above, while still achieving the objectives \\nof grouping swaps with similar characteristics and reducing unnecessary \\ncomplexity for market participants in determining whether their swaps \\nare classified within a particular swap category.\\nc.

Credit Swap Data Analysis\\n    As noted above, the Commission proposed using tenor and \\nconventional spread criteria to define swap categories for CDS indexes. \\nThe Commission proposed the following six broad tenor groups in the \\ncredit asset class: (1) Zero to two years (0-746 days); (2) over two to \\nfour years (747-1,476 days); (3) over four to six years (1,477-2,207 \\ndays) (which include the five-year tenor); (4) over six to eight-and-a-\\nhalf years (2,208-3,120 days); (5) over eight-and-a-half to\\n\\n[[Page 32882]]\\n\\n12.5 years (3,121-4,581 days) and (6) greater than 12.5 years (4,581 \\ndays).\\\\121\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\121\\\\ The Commission assessed the possibility of applying the \\ntenor categories proposed for swaps in the interest rate asset class \\nto the distribution of notional sizes in the CDS indexes and \\nanticipates the level of granularity proposed to categorize swaps in \\nthe interest rate asset class by tenor would be inappropriate for \\nthe CDS index market. The Commission anticipates that this level of \\ngranularity would be inappropriate because the vast majority of CDS \\nindex transactions in the data set had a tenor of five years (or \\napproximately 1,825 days). Based on the concentration of CDS index \\ntransactions in five-year tenors, the Commission proposed six tenor \\nbands for CDS indexes.\\n    The Commission chose to extend the tenor groups about one-half \\nmonth beyond the commonly observed tenors to group similar tenors \\ntogether and capture variations in day counts. The Commission added \\nan additional 15 days beyond a multiple of one year to the number of \\ndays in each group to avoid ending each group on specific years.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    With respect to the conventional spread criterion, the Commission \\ndetermined ranges of spread values based on a review of the \\ndistribution of spreads in the entire CDS data set.\\\\122\\\\ In particular, \\nthe Commission observed that the relevant CDS data set partitioned at \\nthe 175 basis points (``bps\\'\\') and 350 bps levels.\\\\123\\\\ The Commission \\nfound that significant differences existed in the CDS data set between \\nCDS indexes with spread values under 175 bps and those in the other two \\nCDS categories (spread values between 175 to 350 bps; spread values \\nabove 350 bps). Accordingly, the Commission proposed three separate \\nconventional spread levels: (1) CDS indexes with spread values under \\n175 bps; (2) CDS indexes with spread values between 175 and 350 bps; \\nand (3) CDS indexes with spread values above 350 bps. Table 9 shows the \\nsummary statistics of the proposed criteria to determine swap \\ncategories for swaps in the credit asset class.\\\\124\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\122\\\\ See supra note 77 for a definition of ``conventional \\nspread.\\'\\'\\n    \\\\123\\\\ The Commission proposed partition levels by a qualitative \\nexamination of multiple histogram distributions of the traded and \\nfixed spreads from the CDS data set. This qualitative examination \\nwas confirmed through a partition test (using JMP software), \\nincluding both before and after controlling for the effects of tenor \\non the distribution. The Commission observed that 175 bps explained \\nthe greatest difference in means of the two data sets resulting from \\na single partition of the data. The Commission also observed that \\n350 bps was an appropriate partition for CDS index transactions with \\nspreads over 175 bps.\\n    \\\\124\\\\ The Commission found that these categories were good \\npredictors of notional size. This finding was based on an analysis \\nwhich used the tenor and spread categories in Table 9 as explanatory \\nvariables in a least squares regression, where the logged value of \\nthe notional amount of the swap was the dependent variable.\\n\\n Table 9--CDS Index Sample Statistics by Proposed Swap Category Criteria\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                    Sum of notional\\n             Spread                  amounts  (in      Number of trades\\n                                   billions of USD)\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n<=175...........................               3,761              59,887\\n175-to-350......................                 233              11,045\\n350>............................                 577              27,998\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n \\n                                    Sum of notional\\n    Tenor  (in calendar days)           amounts        Number of trades\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n0-746...........................                 146               1,421\\n747-1,476.......................                 569               6,774\\n1,477-2,207.....................               3,490              79,357\\n2,208-3,120.....................                 159               2,724\\n3,121-4,581.....................                  18                 497\\n4,582+..........................                 190               8,157\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission sought comment on this proposed approach, a series \\nof alternative criteria to be used, and alternative categories.

In general, the Commission \\nbelieves that the proposed criteria--tenor and conventional spread--\\nprovide an appropriate way to group swaps with economic similarities \\nand to reduce unnecessary complexity for market participants in \\ndetermining whether a particular swap is classified within a particular \\nswap category. In regard to ISDA/SIFMA\\'s suggested clarification, the \\nCommission clarifies that the spread for a CDS transaction will be \\nbased on the traded spread, rather than on the fixed coupon.\\n    Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed tenor and \\nconventional spread categories sufficiently capture the variation in \\nnotional size that is necessary for setting appropriate minimum block \\nsizes and that refining these categories as suggested by commenters \\nwill not improve the clustering of swaps in order to better set \\nappropriate minimum block sizes. For example, the Commission notes that \\nthe tenor buckets contained in the adopted rule generally result in \\nseparate categorization for on-the-run and off-the-run indexes for \\nswaps in the CDS data set. On-the-run indexes, for example, comprised \\nthe vast majority of swaps in the 4-6 year tenor bucket, while off-the-\\nrun indexes were the vast majority of swaps in the 0-2, 2-4, and 6-8.5 \\nyear tenor buckets.\\n    The Commission determined these swap categories based on the way \\nactivity in the CDS data set clustered towards the center of each tenor \\nband. While the majority of transactions in the CDS data set consisted \\nof on-the-run corporate credit default index swaps with a five-year \\ntenor, the Commission found that significant trading of corporate \\ncredit default index swaps also occurred in other tenor ranges.\\\\137\\\\ \\nThe Commission believes that its approach is appropriate since CDS on \\nindexes other than corporate indexes (e.g., asset backed indexes, \\nmunicipal indexes, sovereign indexes) also trade at tenors other than \\nfive years.\\\\138\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\137\\\\ For example, based on the observed CDS data set, corporate \\nCDS indexes traded in all but the longest of the tenor groups. The \\nvast majority of transactions outside of the 4-6 year tenor group \\nwere off-the-run series.\\n    \\\\138\\\\ For example, based on the observed CDS data set, the \\nmajority of municipal credit default index swaps traded with tenors \\nof around 10 years.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission, however, decided not to use ``on-the-run\\'\\' or \\n``off-the-run\\'\\' designations for grouping CDS indexes into categories \\nfor the following reasons: (i) The underlying components of swaps with \\ndiffering versions or series based on the same named index are broadly \\nsimilar, if not the same, and are indicative of economic \\nsubstitutability across versions or series; (ii) differences in the \\naverage notional amount across differing versions or series were \\nexplained by differences in tenor; and (iii) using versions or series \\nas the criterion for defining CDS swap categories may result in an \\nunnecessary level of complexity.\\\\139\\\\ Hence, the Commission believes \\nthat while on-the-run and off-the-run indexes may differ in terms of \\navailable liquidity, they nonetheless are economically related to each \\nother within the categories proposed by the Commission; therefore, on-\\nthe-run indexes could be used to offset much of the risk associated \\nwith off-the-run indices. Moreover, while the off-the-run swaps \\ngenerally had less trading activity, and presumably less liquidity, \\nthan the on-the-run swaps, off-the-run index swaps had larger notional \\nsizes, on average, than on-the run swaps in the same category. Hence, \\nthe more liquid, on-the-run swaps will drive the block size in a \\ncategory and will result in lower block sizes for the less liquid swaps \\nin the category.\\\\140\\\\ The Commission feels that this is a more \\nconservative approach to setting block sizes for less liquid swaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\139\\\\ An on-the-run CDS index represents the most recently \\nissued version of an index. For example, every six months, Dow Jones \\nselects 125 investment grade entities domiciled in North America to \\nmake up the Dow Jones North American investment grade index \\n(``CDX.NA.IG\\'\\'). Each new CDX.NA.IG index is given a new series \\nnumber while market participants continue to trade the old or ``off-\\nthe-run\\'\\' CDX.NA.IG series. The index provider determines the \\ncomposition of each index through a defined list of reference \\nentities. The index provider has discretion to change the \\ncomposition of the list of reference entities for each new version \\nor series of an index. In its analysis of the CDS data set, the \\nCommission generally observed either no change or a small change \\n(ranging from one percent to ten percent) of existing composition in \\nthe reference entities underlying a new version or series of an \\nindex. Because of these two dynamics (tenor and index composition), \\nthe CDS data set contained transactions within a given index with \\ndifferent versions and series that were, in some instances, \\nidentical, and in others, not identical, across varying tenors.\\n    \\\\140\\\\ This is similar to the example provided for the tenor \\ngroupings in interest rate swaps in Section II.A.1.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In response to the commenters that specifically requested a \\ndifferentiation between on-the-run and off-the-run CDS indexes, the \\nCommission believes that while on-the-run and off-the-run indexes may \\ndiffer in terms of available liquidity, they nonetheless are \\neconomically related to each other within the categories proposed by \\nthe Commission such that on-the-run indexes could be used to offset \\nmuch of the risk associated with off-the-run indexes. The Commission \\nalso notes that the tenor buckets contained in the adopted rule \\ngenerally result in separate categorization for on-the-run and off-the-\\nrun indexes. For the CDS data set, the vast majority of swaps in the 4-\\n6 year tenor bucket were on-the-run indexes, while the vast majority of \\nswaps in the 0-2, 2-4, and 6-8.5 year tenor buckets were off-the-run.\\n    In response to commenters that specifically recommended separate \\nswap categorization for tranches, the Commission believes that the \\nproposed swap categorization based upon conventional spread criteria \\nwill result in separate categorizations related to tranches where \\nappropriate.\\\\141\\\\ For example, tranches having significantly different \\nlevels of risk will potentially have spreads traded at levels that \\ndiffer enough from the underlying index so as to be placed in \\ncategories that would receive a different block trade size. The \\nconventional spread reflects the risk of the underlying transaction and \\nthe Commission believes that the risk associated with the transaction \\nwill be the primary determinant of how difficult a transaction is to \\nhedge. Thus, the Commission believes that categorization of CDS by \\nconventional spread will capture differences related to tranches where \\nappropriate.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\141\\\\ In the CDS market, a ``tranche\\'\\' means a particular \\nsegment of the loss distribution of the underlying CDS index. For \\nexample, tranches may be specified by the loss distribution for \\nequity, mezzanine (junior) debt, and senior debt on the referenced \\nentities. The Commission found that the tranche-level data was even \\nmore granular than index-level data. Similarly, the Commission \\nanticipates that grouping the relevant CDS data set in tranche \\ncriterion may not be practicable because it may produce too many \\nswap categories and as a result would impose unnecessary complexity \\non market participants.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission notes that the adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(2) establishes \\n18 separate swap categories for CDS swaps. While none of the commenters \\nprovided suggestions as to precisely how to categorize CDS by tranche, \\nthe Commission believes that creating additional swap categories for \\ntranches would result in swap categories totaling a multiple of the \\nproposed 18 swap categories, as each CDS index has multiple tranches. \\nEstablishing swap categories based upon tenor and\\n\\n[[Page 32884]]\\n\\nconventional spread criterion as in adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(2) meets the \\nobjectives of grouping swaps with economic similarity and reducing \\nconfusion for market participants in determining whether their swaps \\nare classified within a particular swap category.\\n    The Commission believes that this approach will mitigate the \\nadministrative burden to both market participants and to the Commission \\nby limiting the number of swap categories for which appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes need to be calculated. In regard to Barclay\\'s concern that \\nswaps would move between categories, the Commission believes that \\ninstances where a given swap will move daily between spread levels will \\nbe limited given the small number of spread categories and the observed \\ndistribution of trades. Additionally, the quantitative nature of the \\nblock category calculation should limit the operational risk by \\nproviding clarity and ease of notice to market participants as to what \\nthe minimum block sizes are, even if they are subject to change.\\n    If market participants reach the conclusion that the Commission has \\ndetermined specific swap categories in a way that will materially \\nreduce market liquidity, then those participants are encouraged to \\nsubmit data to support their conclusion. If, through its own \\nsurveillance of swaps market activity, the Commission becomes aware \\nthat a specific swap categorization for determination of appropriate \\nminimum block levels would reduce market liquidity, then the Commission \\nmay exercise its legal authority to take action by rule or order to \\nmitigate the potential effects on market liquidity with respect to \\nswaps in that swap category.\\n2. Swap Category in the Equity Asset Class\\n    The Commission proposed a single swap category for swaps in the \\nequity asset class. The Commission proposed this approach based on: (1) \\nThe existence of a highly liquid underlying cash market for equities; \\n(2) the absence of time delays for reporting block trades in the \\nunderlying equity cash market; (3) the small relative size of the \\nequity index swaps market relative to the futures, options, and cash \\nequity index markets; and (4) the Commission\\'s goal to protect the \\nprice discovery function of the underlying equity cash market and \\nfutures market.\\n    The Commission received six comments regarding swap categories in \\nthe equity asset class. AFR supported the single swap category proposed \\nfor the equity asset class.\\\\142\\\\ Five other commenters recommended that \\nthe Commission treat equity swaps similarly to the other asset classes \\nand establish swap categories based upon a range of criteria.\\\\143\\\\ AII \\nrecommended that equity swaps should be treated as blocks based on \\nliquidity, and urged the Commission to consider linking equity swap \\ncategories to the liquidity of the underlying index.\\\\144\\\\ Barclays \\nrecommended that swap categories should be established for equity swaps \\ntaking into account transaction volume by index and equity asset class \\ntype, and that broad-based indices should have separate block levels \\nbased upon futures market levels.\\\\145\\\\ ICI recommended closer study of \\ndata on equity swap transactions due to potential differences in \\nliquidity in the underlying equity cash market.\\\\146\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA \\nrecommended categorizing equity swaps on the basis of underlying index \\nor basket, product type, notional size, and tenor.\\\\147\\\\ SIFMA stated \\nthat the Commission should establish equity swap block categories based \\nupon liquidity of the underlying indices.\\\\148\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\142\\\\ CL-AFR at 6.\\n    \\\\143\\\\ CL-AII at 9; CL-Barclays at 9; CL-ICI at; ISDA/SIFMA at \\n10-11; SIFMA at 5.\\n    \\\\144\\\\ CL-AII at 9.\\n    \\\\145\\\\ CL-Barclays at 9.\\n    \\\\146\\\\ CL-ICI at 5.\\n    \\\\147\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 10-11.\\n    \\\\148\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(b)(3) as proposed. While a number of the commenters \\npoint out differences in liquidity in the underlying equity indices to \\nsupport separate swap categories within the equity asset class and \\nestablishment of block sizes in equities, these differences do not \\nundermine the premises underlying the Commission\\'s proposal. Even \\ntaking into account differences in liquidity, (1) there is still a \\nhighly liquid underlying cash market for equities; and (2) the equity \\nindex swaps market is small relative to the futures, options, and cash \\nequity index markets. These characteristics, combined with the fact \\nthat there are no time delays for reporting block trades in the \\nunderlying equity cash market, makes establishment of swap categories, \\nand therefore minimum block thresholds, for equity swaps \\ninappropriate.\\\\149\\\\ The Commission notes that establishing time delays \\nfor reporting block trades in the swaps market when no time delays \\nexist could negatively impact the price discovery function of the \\nunderlying equity cash market and futures market. Accordingly, the \\nCommission is adopting Sec.  43.6(b)(3) as proposed.\\\\150\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\149\\\\ See infra Section II.B(5)(b). In the event that time \\ndelays are established for reporting block trades in the underlying \\nequity cash market, the Commission may consider establishing swap \\ncategories and minimum block thresholds for equity swaps.\\n    \\\\150\\\\ The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC\\'\\') has \\nproposed general criteria that it would consider to set appropriate \\nminimum block trade sizes for security-based swaps. The SEC, \\nhowever, has not proposed specific numerical thresholds at this \\ntime, but rather intends to propose such thresholds upon the \\nadoption of Regulation SBSR--Reporting and Dissemination of \\nSecurity-Based Swap Information. 75 FR 75208, 75228 (Dec. 2, 2010). \\nOn May 1, 2013, the SEC reopened the comment period regarding this \\nproposed rule. See Reopening of Comment Periods for Certain \\nRulemaking Releases and Policy Statement Applicable to Security-\\nBased Swaps Proposed Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \\nand the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \\n(May 1, 2013).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Swap Categories in the FX Asset Class\\n    The Commission proposed establishing swap categories for the FX \\nasset class based on unique currency combinations, with Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(4)(i) distinguishing futures-related swaps \\\\151\\\\ from swaps \\nthat are not futures-related (covered under proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(4)(ii)). Distinguishing futures-related swaps from other swaps \\nwould allow the Commission to set initial appropriate minimum block \\nsizes for certain swaps based on DCM block sizes for FX futures \\ncontracts.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\151\\\\ Under Sec.  43.2, a futures-related swap is defined as a \\nswap (as defined in section 1a(47) of the Act and as further defined \\nby the Commission in implementing regulations) that is economically \\nrelated to a futures contract. See infra notes 169-174 and \\naccompanying text. Under Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i), a futures-related swap \\nis a swap where one of the underlying currencies of the swap is the \\nsubject of a futures contract listed on a DCM.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission based its approach on the assumption that FX swaps \\nand futures contracts based upon the same currency draw upon the same \\nliquidity pools. The Commission proposed in Sec. Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) \\nand (b)(4)(ii) to distinguish FX swaps and instruments based on the \\nexistence of a related futures contract. Liquidity in the underlying \\nfutures market for the currency combinations established in proposed \\nSec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) suggested sufficient liquidity in the swaps market \\nfor these currency combinations.\\n    The Commission proposed establishing swap categories for futures-\\nrelated swaps under proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) based on the unique \\ncurrency combinations between the currency of each of the following: \\nthe United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, \\nSwitzerland, Canada, Republic of South Africa, Republic of Korea, \\nKingdom of Sweden, New Zealand, Kingdom of Norway, Denmark, Brazil, \\nChina, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, New\\n\\n[[Page 32885]]\\n\\nZealand, Poland, Russia, and Turkey.\\\\152\\\\ Hence, proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(4)(i) would establish a separate swap category for each of the \\n231 unique currency combinations between these currencies. In proposed \\nSec.  43.6(b)(4)(ii), the Commission would establish an additional swap \\ncategory based on unique currency combinations not included in proposed \\nSec.  43.6(b)(4)(i).\\\\153\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\152\\\\ For example, the euro (EUR) and the Canadian dollar (CAD) \\ncombination would be one swap category; whereas, the Swedish krona \\n(SEK) and the Korean won (KRW) combination would be a separate swap \\ncategory.\\n    \\\\153\\\\ Under proposed Sec.  43.6(e)(2), swaps having currency \\ncombinations described in Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(ii) would all be eligible \\nto be treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. \\nOnly in the post-initial period would the proposed rules set an \\nappropriate minimum block size for this category of FX swaps. See \\ninfra Section II.B(5)(c)(ii).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received six comments regarding the proposed swap \\ncategories for the FX asset class based on unique currency \\ncombinations. Two commenters recommended additional swap categories for \\nthe FX asset class.\\\\154\\\\ Barclays suggested that EUR- and USD-\\ndenominated transactions should be categorized separately from less \\nliquid transactions and that distinct block levels should apply to the \\nfollowing product categories: Forwards, non-deliverable forwards, non-\\ndeliverable options, vanilla options, and other more complex \\noptions.\\\\155\\\\ GFMA recommended more granular swap categories that would \\ngroup specific instruments according to similarity of liquidity \\nprofile.\\\\156\\\\ AFR, however, commented that the governing principle in \\nestablishing swap categories should be the reasonable relationship of \\nswaps within a category to a liquid class of swaps or futures that are \\npotential hedges for that category and expressed concern that adding \\nany additional granularity might violate this principle.\\\\157\\\\ AII and \\nICI urged the Commission to remove block trading thresholds so that all \\ntransactions would be treated as blocks for the FX asset class during \\nthe initial period, and allow for collection and analysis of SDR data \\nduring this period to determine appropriate swap categories for the \\npost-initial period.\\\\158\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\154\\\\ CL-Barclays at 10; CL-GFMA at 2-3.\\n    \\\\155\\\\ CL-Barclays at 10.\\n    \\\\156\\\\ CL-GFMA at 2-3. GFMA also suggested that (1) FX swaps \\nshould be distinguished by tenor, and that (2) block size thresholds \\nshould vary based on time of day, in order to take into account \\nliquidity across time zones.\\n    \\\\157\\\\ CL-AFR at 6.\\n    \\\\158\\\\ CL-AII at 3; CL-ICI at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission notes that, since the Further Block Proposal, \\nTreasury has issued a Final Determination, pursuant to sections \\n1a(47)(E)(i) and 1b of the CEA, that exempts FX swaps and FX forwards \\nfrom the definition of ``swap\\'\\' under the CEA. Therefore, the \\nrequirements of section 2(a)(13) of the CEA would not apply to those \\ntransactions, and such transactions would not be subject to part 43 of \\nthe Commission\\'s regulations.\\\\159\\\\ Nevertheless, section 1a(47)(E)(iii) \\nof the CEA provides that FX swaps and FX forwards transactions still \\nare not excluded from regulatory reporting requirements to an SDR. \\nFurther, the Commission notes that Treasury\\'s final determination \\nexcludes FX swaps and FX forwards, but does not apply to FX options or \\nnon-deliverable FX forwards. As such, FX instruments that are not \\ncovered by Treasury\\'s final determination are subject to part 43 of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\159\\\\ See Determination of Foreign Exchange Swaps and Foreign \\nExchange Forwards under the Commodity Exchange Act, 77 FR 69,694, \\nNov. 20, 2012.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received and the complexity of \\nthe proposed approach, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(b)(4) with \\nmodifications. The Commission is modifying proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) \\nto establish swap categories based on the unique currency combinations \\nbetween one super-major currency paired with one of the following: (1) \\nAnother super major currency \\\\160\\\\; (2) a major currency \\\\161\\\\; or (3) \\na currency of Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, \\nNew Zealand, Poland, Russia, or Turkey. This approach differs from the \\nproposal in that the adopted swap categories will not include the \\nunique currency combinations between major currencies and other major \\ncurrencies, between major currencies and each of the ten additional \\nenumerated non-major currencies, and between the ten additional \\nenumerated non-major currencies. Under Sec.  43.6(b)(4) as adopted, all \\nswap transactions subject to part 43 \\\\162\\\\ in these unique currency \\ncombinations may be treated as blocks.\\\\163\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\160\\\\ As set out in Section II.A.1., the super-major currencies \\nare the United States dollar (USD), European Union Euro Area euro \\n(EUR), United Kingdom pound sterling (GBP), and Japan yen (JPY).\\n    \\\\161\\\\ As set out in Section II.A.1., the major currencies are \\nthe Australia dollar (AUD), Switzerland franc (CHF), Canada dollar \\n(CAD), Republic of South Africa rand (ZAR), Republic of Korea won \\n(KRW), Kingdom of Sweden krona (SEK), New Zealand dollar (NZD), \\nKingdom of Norway krone (NOK) and Denmark krone (DKK).\\n    \\\\162\\\\ As stated above, this section only applies to FX options \\nand non-deliverable FX forwards. Treasury has exempted FX swaps and \\nFX forwards from the definition of ``swap\\'\\' under the CEA. See \\nDetermination of Foreign Exchange Swaps and Foreign Exchange \\nForwards under the Commodity Exchange Act, 77 FR 69,694, Nov. 20, \\n2012.\\n    \\\\163\\\\ See Table 10 for the enumerated swap categories \\nestablished by Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The changes to Sec.  43.6(b)(4) will significantly reduce the \\nnumber of swap categories, hence reducing complexity, but will still \\nensure coverage of the most liquid currency combinations.\\\\164\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\164\\\\ According to the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey: \\nForeign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity in April 2010 \\n(preliminary results, dated September 2010), the currency \\ncombinations enumerated under adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) comprise \\nmore than 80% of global FX market turnover.\\n    According to the Survey of North American Foreign Exchange \\nVolume in October 2012, the proposed categories established by Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(4)(i) cover more than 86% of the notional value of total \\nmonthly volume of FX swaps that are priced or facilitated by traders \\nin North America. The Survey of North American Foreign Exchange \\nVolume is conducted by the Foreign Exchange Committee, which \\nincludes representatives of major financial institutions engaged in \\nforeign currency trading in the United States and is sponsored by \\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The survey is designed to \\nmeasure the level of turnover in the foreign exchange market. \\nTurnover is defined as the gross value in U.S. dollar equivalents of \\npurchases and sales entered into during the reporting period. The \\ndata covers a one-month period in order to reduce the likelihood \\nthat very short-term variations in activity might distort the data \\nand include all transactions that are priced or facilitated by \\ntraders in North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). \\nTransactions concluded by dealers outside of North America are \\nexcluded even if they are booked to an office within North America. \\nThe survey also excludes transactions between branches, \\nsubsidiaries, affiliates, and trading desks of the same firm. The \\nOctober 2012 data can be located at <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfed.org/fxc/2012/octfxsurvey2012.pdf\">http://www.newyorkfed.org/fxc/2012/octfxsurvey2012.pdf</a>.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    While not affording block treatment to all swaps in the FX asset \\nclass subject to part 43, these modifications will increase the number \\nof currency combinations which will be eligible to be blocks, many of \\nwhich have limited liquidity.\\\\165\\\\ Yet, this modified approach still \\nallows the Commission to set initial appropriate minimum block sizes \\nfor the most liquid categories based on the block trade size thresholds \\nset by DCMs for economically-related futures contracts, as enumerated \\nunder adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i). The Commission believes that the \\ncategories established by proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) and kept under \\nadopted Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) provide the separate classification for \\nEUR- and USD-denominated transactions recommended by Barclays.\\\\166\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\165\\\\ For example, the unique currency combination of the \\nAustralian Dollar (AUD) and the Canadian Dollar (CAD) had a minimum \\nblock threshold of 10,000,000 CAD in the Further Block Proposal. \\nUnder adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(4), all trades in this unique currency \\ncombination will be eligible for block treatment.\\n    \\\\166\\\\ The Commission emphasizes that the swap categories for the \\nFX asset class are unique currency combinations between each of the \\nsuper-major currencies, major currencies, and additional currencies \\nlisted. The classification of EUR and USD as super-major currencies \\nsimply means that both currencies are individually eligible for \\ninclusion among the unique currency combinations used for swap \\ncategorization. In the FX asset class, there is no separate bucket \\nfor super-major currencies (such as the buckets in the interest rate \\nswap asset class described above).\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 32886]]\\n\\n    The Commission will also modify Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(ii) to establish \\none swap category for the currency combinations not included in Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(4)(i). This category will encompass the other currency \\ncombinations proposed, but not adopted, by the Commission, as well as \\nother non-futures related currency swaps. With the modifications to \\nSec.  43.6(b)(4), the euro (EUR) and the Canadian dollar (CAD) \\ncombination will still be one swap category as in the original proposal \\npursuant to Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i). However, the Swedish krona (SEK) and \\nthe Korean won (KRW) combination will be grouped with all the other \\nswaps covered by Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(ii) into one swap category. As a \\nfurther example, a swap of the Czech koruna (CZK) and the Brazilian \\nreal (BRL) will be in the same category as the SEK-KRW swap. While the \\nswaps grouped into one category by Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(ii) may have \\ndifferent liquidity levels, these swaps will all be subject to the time \\ndelays provided to block trades and large notional off-facility swaps \\nin both the initial and post-initial periods.\\n    The Commission notes that the adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) \\nestablishes 78 unique currency combinations, covering a vast majority \\nof the notional value of FX swaps concluded by traders in North \\nAmerica. Creating additional swap categories, as suggested by Barclays \\nand GFMA,\\\\167\\\\ would result in swap categories totaling a multiple of \\nthis already large number without drastically increasing the number of \\nswaps that will be subject to real-time reporting without a delay. \\nEstablishing swap categories based upon unique currency combinations as \\nin adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) meets the objectives of grouping swaps \\nwith economic similarity and reducing confusion for market participants \\nin determining whether their swaps are classified within a particular \\nswap category. The Commission believes that these changes will reduce \\nthe administrative burden to both market participants and to the \\nCommission by reducing the number of swap categories for which \\nappropriate minimum block sizes need to be calculated.\\\\168\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\167\\\\ CL-Barclays at 10; CL-GFMA at 2-3.\\n    \\\\168\\\\ In the Further Block Proposal, every unique currency \\ncombination would be considered a unique swap category, which means \\nthere would be hundreds of different swap categories for the FX \\nasset class. Proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) alone established 231 swap \\ncategories. Many additional categories would have been established \\nunder proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(ii). The adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(4) \\ncreates 78 categories requiring the calculation of appropriate \\nminimum block sizes in the post-initial period.\\n\\n                                            Table 10--Swap Categories Established Under Sec.   43.6(b)(4)(i)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                                                    Super-major currencies\\n                                     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                              Euro  (EUR)              British pound (GBP)           Japanese yen (JPY)           U.S. dollar (USD)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBritish Pound (GBP).................

Swap Categories in the Other Commodity Asset Class\\n    The Commission proposed to determine swap categories in the other \\ncommodity asset class based on three sets of groupings. The first two \\nsets of groupings create categories of swaps which are economically \\nrelated to specific futures contracts (i.e., futures-related swaps \\n\\\\169\\\\) or swap contracts under proposed Sec. Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i) and \\n(ii). The third set of groupings creates categories based on swaps \\nsharing a common product type under proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(iii).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\169\\\\ Proposed Sec.  43.2 defines a futures-related swap as a \\nswap (as defined in section 1a(47) of the Act and as further defined \\nby the Commission in implementing regulations) that is economically \\nrelated to a futures contract. The Commission is adopting this \\ndefinition as proposed.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission proposed defining ``economically related\\'\\' \\\\170\\\\ in \\nSec.  43.2 as a direct or indirect reference to the same commodity at \\nthe same delivery location or locations,\\\\171\\\\ or with the\\n\\n[[Page 32887]]\\n\\nsame or substantially similar cash market price series.\\\\172\\\\ The \\nCommission noted that this definition would (1) ensure that swap \\ncontracts with shared reference price characteristics indicating \\neconomic substitutability (i.e., swaps in the category can be used to \\noffset some or all of the risks associated with positions in the \\nunderlying commodity) are grouped together within a common swap \\ncategory; \\\\173\\\\ and (2) provide further clarity as to which swaps are \\ndescribed in Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii)(B), which was previously finalized \\nunder the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule.\\\\174\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\170\\\\ In the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission \\nexplained: ``For the purposes of part 43, swaps are economically \\nrelated, as described in Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii)(B), if such contract \\nutilizes as its sole floating reference price the prices generated \\ndirectly or indirectly from the price of a single contract described \\nin appendix B to part 43.\\'\\' 77 FR 1211. Further, the Commission \\nexplained that ``an `indirect\\' price link to an Enumerated Physical \\nCommodity Contract or an Other Contract described in appendix B to \\npart 43 includes situations where the swap reference price is linked \\nto prices of a cash-settled contract described in appendix B to part \\n43 that itself is cash-settled based on a physical-delivery \\nsettlement price to such contract.\\'\\' Id. at n.289.\\n    \\\\171\\\\ For example, a swap utilizing the Platts Gas Daily/Platts \\nIFERC reference price is economically related to the Henry Hub \\nNatural Gas (NYMEX) (futures) contract because it is based on the \\nsame commodity at the same delivery location as that underlying the \\nlatter contract.\\n    \\\\172\\\\ For example, a swap utilizing the Standard and Poor\\'s \\n(``S&P\\'\\') 500 reference price is economically related to the S&P 500 \\nStock Index futures contract because it is based on the same cash \\nmarket price series.\\n    \\\\173\\\\ The Commission proposed to amend Sec.  43.2 to define \\n``reference price\\'\\' as a floating price series (including \\nderivatives contract and cash market prices or price indices) used \\nby the parties to a swap or swaption to determine payments made, \\nexchanged or accrued under the terms of a swap contract. The \\nCommission proposed to use this term in connection with the \\nestablishment of a method through which parties to a swap \\ntransaction may elect to apply the lowest appropriate minimum block \\nsize applicable to one component swap category of such swap \\ntransaction. See infra Section II.B(6)(b). The Commission is \\nadopting this definition as proposed.\\n    \\\\174\\\\ The Real-Time Reporting Final Rule previously finalized \\nSec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii)(B), which requires a registered SDR to publicly \\ndisseminate any publicly reportable swap transaction in the other \\ncommodity asset class that is ``economically related\\'\\' to one of the \\ncontracts described in appendix B to part 43, but did not define \\n``economically related.\\'\\' This definition, as proposed and to be \\nadopted here, would apply to the use of this term throughout all of \\npart 43 of the Commission\\'s regulations.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The first set of swap categories, covered under proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(i), would establish separate swap categories for swaps that \\nare economically related to one of the contracts listed in appendix B \\nto part 43. Therefore, proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i) would establish one \\nswap category for each contract listed in appendix B to part 43. The \\nReal-Time Reporting Final Rule previously finalized appendix B to part \\n43, which lists 29 Enumerated Physical Commodity Contracts and Other \\nContracts (i.e., Brent Crude Oil (ICE)).\\\\175\\\\ In the Further Block \\nProposal, the Commission proposed to add 13 electricity and natural gas \\nswap contracts to appendix B to part 43.\\\\176\\\\ Therefore, proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(i) would establish 42 swap categories such that each \\ncontract would be the basis for its own other commodity swap category, \\nand all swaps that are economically related to that contract would be \\nincluded in that swap category.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\175\\\\ As noted by the Commission in the Real-Time Reporting \\nFinal Rule, the 28 Enumerated Physical Commodity Contracts are \\ntraded on U.S. DCMs, while Brent Crude Oil (ICE) futures contracts \\nare primarily traded in Europe. 77 FR 1211 n. 288.\\n    \\\\176\\\\ See infra Section II.B5(d)(i). The Commission had \\npreviously issued orders deeming these contracts as ``significant \\nprice discovery contracts\\'\\' in connection with trading on exempt \\ncommercial markets (``ECMs\\'\\'), based on, among other factors, their \\nmaterial liquidity and price discovery function. See infra Section \\nIII.C(4)(a). These contracts included: AECO Financial Basis Contract \\n(``AEC\\'\\') traded on the IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (``ICE\\'\\') \\n(See 75 FR 23697); NWP Rockies Financial Basis Contract (``NWR\\'\\') \\ntraded on ICE (See 75 FR 23704); PG&E Citygate Financial Basis \\nContract (``PGE\\'\\') traded on ICE (See 75 FR 23710); Waha Financial \\nBasis Contract (``WAH\\'\\') traded on ICE (See 75 FR 24655); Socal \\nBorder Financial Basis Contract (``SCL\\'\\') traded on ICE (See 75 FR \\n24648); HSC Financial Basis Contract (``HXS\\'\\') traded on ICE (See 75 \\nFR 24641); ICE Chicago Financial Basis Contract (``DGD\\'\\') traded on \\nICE (See 75 FR 24633); SP-15 Financial Day-Ahead LMP Peak Contract \\n(``SPM\\'\\') traded on ICE (See 75 FR 42380); SP-15 Financial Day-Ahead \\nLMP Off-Peak Contract (``OFP\\'\\') traded on ICE (See 75 FR 42380); PJM \\nWH Real Time Peak Contract (``PJM\\'\\') traded on ICE (See 75 FR \\n42390); PJM WH Real Time Off-Peak Contract (``OPJ\\'\\') traded on ICE \\n(See 75 FR 42390); Mid-C Financial Peak Contract (``MDC\\'\\') traded on \\nICE (See 75 FR 38469); Mid-C Financial Off-Peak Contract (``OMC\\'\\') \\ntraded on ICE (See 75 FR 38469).\\n    As discussed further below, as of October 12, 2012, ICE withdrew \\nits listing of these contracts as a result of converting its cleared \\nOTC swap contracts and related options to futures listed at ICE \\nFutures U.S. and ICE Futures Europe. Accordingly, ICE converted \\nthese contracts into economically equivalent futures contracts and \\nhas listed them for trading. See ICE--Swaps to Futures Transition, \\n<a href=\"https://www.theice.com/S2F.jhtml\">https://www.theice.com/S2F.jhtml</a> (last visited May 7, 2013). \\nTherefore, as discussed further below, the Commission has determined \\nin this final rule to add the converted contracts to appendix B to \\npart 43, such that each contract will serve as a basis for an other \\ncommodity swap category. See infra Section II.A(4).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission has separately enumerated these contracts since it \\npreviously has identified these commodity contracts as: (1) Having high \\nlevels of open interest and significant cash flow; and (2) serving as a \\nreference price for a significant number of cash market transactions. \\nMoreover, the Commission has also previously determined that any swap \\nthat references or is economically related to these contracts (along \\nwith the Brent Crude Oil (ICE) contract or any contract that is \\neconomically related to it) has sufficient liquidity to ensure that the \\npublic dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data for swaps \\nbased on this reference asset poses little risk of disclosing \\nidentities of parties, business transactions, or market positions.\\\\177\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\177\\\\ 77 FR 1211.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The second set of swap categories, covered under proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(ii), would establish swap categories based on swaps in the \\nother commodity asset class that are: (1) Not economically related to \\none of the futures or swap contracts listed in appendix B to part 43; \\nand (2) economically related to a relevant futures contract that is \\nsubject to the block trade rules of a DCM. Proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(ii) listed the 18 futures contracts to which these swaps are \\neconomically related, and hence, establishes 18 swap categories.\\\\178\\\\ \\nThese swap categories would include any swap that is economically \\nrelated to such contracts. The swap categories established by proposed \\nSec.  43.6(b)(5)(i) differ from the swap categories established by \\nproposed Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(ii) in that the former may be economically \\nrelated to futures or swap contracts that are not subject to the block \\ntrade rules of a DCM, whereas the latter are economically related to \\nfutures contracts that are subject to the block trade rules of a \\nDCM.\\\\179\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\178\\\\ As proposed, these additional other commodity swap \\ncategories would be based on the following futures contracts: CME \\nCheese; CBOT Distillers\\' Dried Grain; CBOT Dow Jones-UBS Commodity \\nIndex Excess Return; CBOT Ethanol; CME Frost Index; CME Goldman \\nSachs Commodity Index (GSCI) (GSCI Excess Return Index); NYMEX Gulf \\nCoast Gasoline; NYMEX Gulf Coast Sour Crude Oil; NYMEX Gulf Coast \\nUltra Low Sulfur Diesel; CME Hurricane Index; CME International \\nSkimmed Milk Powder; NYMEX New York Harbor Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel; \\nCBOT Nonfarm Payroll; CME Rainfall Index; CME Snowfall Index; CME \\nTemperature Index; CME U.S. Dollar Cash Settled Crude Palm Oil; and \\nCME Wood Pulp.\\n    \\\\179\\\\ This distinction is noteworthy because proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(e)(3) provides that ``[p]ublicly reportable swap transactions \\ndescribed in Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i) that are economically related to a \\nfutures contract in appendix B to this part [43] shall not qualify \\nto be treated as block trades or large notional off-facility swaps \\n(as applicable) [during the initial period], if such futures \\ncontract is not subject to a designated contract market\\'s block \\ntrading rules.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The third set of swap categories, covered under proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(iii), would establish swap categories for all other \\ncommodity swaps that are not categorized under proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(i) or (ii). These swaps are not economically related to any \\nof the contracts listed in appendix B to part 43 or any of the \\ncontracts listed in proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(ii). For these other \\ncommodity swaps, the Commission would determine the appropriate swap \\ncategory based on the product types described in appendix D to part 43 \\nto which the underlying asset(s) of the swap would apply or otherwise \\nrelate. Proposed appendix D to part 43 establishes ``Other Commodity \\nGroups\\'\\' and certain ``Individual Other Commodities\\'\\' within those \\ngroups. To the extent that there is an ``Individual Other Commodity\\'\\' \\nlisted, the Commission would deem the ``Individual Other Commodity\\'\\' as \\na separate swap category. For example, regardless of whether the \\nunderlying asset to an off-facility swap is ``Sugar No. 14\\'\\' or ``Sugar \\nNo. 5,\\'\\' the underlying asset would be grouped as ``Sugar.\\'\\' The \\nCommission thereafter\\n\\n[[Page 32888]]\\n\\nwould set the appropriate minimum block size for each of the swap \\ncategories listed in appendix D to part 43.\\n    In circumstances where a swap does not apply or otherwise relate to \\na specific ``Individual Other Commodity\\'\\' listed under the ``Other \\nCommodity Group\\'\\' in appendix D to part 43, the Commission would \\ncategorize such swap as falling under the respective ``Other\\'\\' swap \\ncategories. For example, an emissions swap would be categorized as \\n``Emissions,\\'\\' while a swap in which the underlying asset is aluminum \\nwould be categorized as ``Base Metals--Other.\\'\\' Additionally, in \\ncircumstances where the underlying asset of swap does not apply or \\notherwise relate to an ``Individual Other Commodity\\'\\' or an ``Other\\'\\' \\nswap category, the Commission would categorize such swap as either \\n``Other Agricultural\\'\\' or ``Other Non-Agricultural.\\'\\'\\n    Comments on the proposed swap categories in the other commodity \\nasset class varied. CME Group agreed with the proposed approach to \\nestablishing swap categories in the other commodity asset class in the \\ninitial period because it would allow appropriate minimum block level \\nsizes to be set based on the minimum block sizes set by DCMs.\\\\180\\\\ ICI, \\nhowever, recommended that the Commission obtain and analyze trading \\ndata from SDRs first before determining whether the proposed swap \\ncategories are appropriate.\\\\181\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\180\\\\ CL-CME 3-4. Proposed Sec.  43.6(e)(1) established \\nappropriate minimum block sizes in the initial period for swap \\ncategories in proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i)-(ii) based on the block \\nsizes for related futures contracts set by DCMs, except for natural \\ngas and electricity swaps proposed to be added to appendix B of part \\n43.\\n    \\\\181\\\\ CL-ICI at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters commented on the granularity of the proposed \\nswap categories. Some commenters recommended more granular categories \\nto account for the differences in liquidity and execution risk between \\nshorter- and longer-dated contracts.\\\\182\\\\ Similarly, Barclays also \\ncommented that swap categories in the other commodity asset class \\nshould consider that products typically experience a reduction in \\nliquidity beyond the first or second year.\\\\183\\\\ Other commenters, \\nhowever, opposed the proposed categories as too narrow and recommended \\nbroadening the definition of ``economically related\\'\\' and reducing the \\nnumber of swap categories to reflect increasing price correlation \\nbetween different categories of commodities as well as existing hedging \\npractices by market participants.\\\\184\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\182\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 4; CL-fia at 3.\\n    \\\\183\\\\ CL-Barclays at 9.\\n    \\\\184\\\\ CL-Better Markets at 6-7; CL-AFR at 6-7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Parity Energy requested that the Commission establish a separate \\ncategory for swaps that are economically related to crude oil options \\nbecause transactions in crude oil options are typically fewer and \\nlarger in size than transactions in crude oil futures contracts.\\\\185\\\\ \\nParity Energy also agreed with the proposed distinction in swap \\ncategories between swaps that are economically related to natural gas \\nswaps and swaps that are economically related to natural gas swap \\noptions.\\\\186\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\185\\\\ CL-Parity at 4-5.\\n    \\\\186\\\\ Id. As proposed, the initial minimum block size for swaps \\nthat are economically related to Henry Hub Natural Gas futures was \\nset at 1,000,000 mmBtu; the initial minimum block size for Henry Hub \\nNatural Gas options was set at 5,500,000 mmBtu.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is adopting the definition of ``economically \\nrelated\\'\\' as proposed. The Commission believes that broadening the \\ndefinition, as suggested by some commenters, would reduce the precision \\nwith which swaps in the other commodity asset class can be properly \\ncategorized. As proposed, the definition of ``economically related\\'\\' is \\nsufficient in that it (1) ensures that swap contracts with shared \\nreference price characteristics (indicating economic substitutability) \\nare grouped together within a common swap category and (2) provides \\nfurther clarity as to which swaps are described in Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(ii)(B).\\n    Furthermore, the Commission believes that its general approach to \\nestablishing swap categories under Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i)-(iii) is \\nappropriate and is adopting the text of Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i)-(iii) \\nlargely as proposed, with the exception of some proposed swap \\ncategories in Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(ii).\\\\187\\\\ With the conversion of the 13 \\nelectricity and natural gas swap contracts proposed to be added to \\nappendix B to part 43 into DCM-listed, economically equivalent futures \\ncontracts,\\\\188\\\\ the Commission is making one modification by \\nestablishing swap categories and adopting initial appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes corresponding to those set by a DCM for those futures \\ncontracts. With respect to the swap categories established under Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(i), the Commission believes that establishing categories for \\nswaps that are economically related to one of the referenced futures \\ncontracts is appropriate because these contracts have previously been \\nidentified as (1) having high levels of open interest and significant \\ncash flow; and (2) serving as a reference price for a significant \\nnumber of cash market transactions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\187\\\\ The Commission is not adopting separate swap categories \\nthat it proposed in the Further Block Proposal for swaps that are \\neconomically related to the following NYMEX futures contracts: Gulf \\nCoast Gasoline; Gulf Coast Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel; and New York \\nHarbor Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel. As of October 15, 2012, NYMEX \\neliminated block trading in these contracts because they have no \\nopen interest. The Commission is also removing the swap category for \\nswaps that reference or are economically related to Non-Farm Payroll \\nfutures contract, the International Skimmed Milk Powder, and Wood \\nPulp as these contracts are no longer listed for trading.\\n    \\\\188\\\\ See supra note 176.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    With respect to the swap categories established under Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(i)-(ii), the Commission is establishing swap categories and \\nadopting initial appropriate minimum block sizes which correspond with \\nthose set by a DCM for economically related futures contracts in the \\ninitial period.\\\\189\\\\ Hence, to the extent possible, the Commission is \\nrelying upon the DCMs\\' knowledge of and experience with liquidity in \\nrelated futures markets until additional data becomes available. With \\nrespect to the swap categories established under Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(iii), \\nthe Commission believes that setting swap categories by product type \\nwould allow the Commission to set appropriate minimum block sizes for \\ngroups of transactions that have similar underlying physical commodity \\nmarket characteristics. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe \\nthat establishing swap categories that are broader than proposed is \\nnecessary to enhance market transparency.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\189\\\\ See infra Section II.B(5)(d).\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 32889]]\\n\\n    Furthermore, the Commission is not using additional criteria to \\ncreate more granular swap categories in the other commodity asset \\nclass. While commodity swaps within a particular swap category may \\nfeature different liquidity and risk profiles based on their tenor, the \\nCommission is not aware of any data that would warrant additional swap \\ncategories. As swaps trading data becomes available, the Commission \\nwill examine such data to determine whether establishing additional \\nswap categories would be appropriate.\\n    The other main modification to the swap categories established \\nunder Sec.  43.6(b)(5) is that the Commission is not adopting separate \\nswap categories for swaps that are economically related to the options \\ncontracts listed in appendix F of the Further Block Proposal.\\\\190\\\\ \\nConsistent with the Commission\\'s definitions of ``economically-\\nrelated\\'\\' and ``futures-related swap,\\'\\' the Commission considers such \\nswaps, which feature an optionality component, to be economically \\nrelated to the corresponding futures contracts adopted in appendix F of \\nthis final rule for purposes of determining swap categories. This \\napproach to categorizing such swaps is consistent with the Commission\\'s \\nmethodology to establish initial appropriate minimum block size for \\nswaps with optionality for all asset classes.\\\\191\\\\ Under this \\nmethodology, the notional size of swaps with optionality in the initial \\nperiod will be equal to the notional size of the swap component without \\nthe optional component. As discussed further below, the Commission is \\nadopting this methodology as proposed, and therefore will not consider \\noptionality in the determination of a swap contract\\'s notional size--\\nallowing block sizes to be established based on the block sizes set by \\nDCMs for options contracts would contradict this approach.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\190\\\\ These options contracts listed in proposed Appendix F, \\nwhich are subject to a minimum DCM block size rule, included Cocoa \\n(ICE); Coffee (ICE); Cotton No. 2 (ICE); Frozen Concentrated Orange \\nJuice (ICE); Gold (COMEX and NYSE Liffe); New York Harbor No. 2 \\nHeating Oil (NYMEX); Silver (COMEX and NYSE Liffe); Sugar \\n<greek-i>11 (ICE); and Sugar <greek-i>16 (ICE).\\n    \\\\191\\\\ See infra Section II.C.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n5. Comments Regarding Swap Categories Across Asset Classes\\n    The Commission received a number of comments suggesting that, for \\nall asset classes, the Commission establish separate swap categories, \\nwith separate appropriate minimum block sizes, for infrequently traded \\nor illiquid swaps. Javelin and SDMA did not think infrequently-traded \\nswaps posed an obstacle and recommended swap categorization that would \\naccount for hedging for illiquid swaps through synthetic/portfolio \\nhedging through liquidity of economically equivalent swaps.\\\\192\\\\ \\nBarclays suggested that all swaps made available to trade that trade \\nless than three times a day should be treated as blocks, as market \\nmakers otherwise will be reluctant to quote prices.\\\\193\\\\ Alternatively, \\nBarclays suggested removing such swaps from the ``available to trade\\'\\' \\ncategory and thereby exempting them from post-trade reporting.\\\\194\\\\ \\nISDA/SIFMA requested block treatment for all infrequently traded swaps \\nand suggested a benchmark tied to precise daily trading frequency \\nincluding a time delay for illiquid products generally.\\\\195\\\\ To support \\nthis approach, ISDA/SIFMA cited a Commission study showing that market \\nparticipants prefer off-exchange bilateral execution for illiquid \\ninstruments because of liquidity concerns.\\\\196\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA suggested \\nthat a single transaction, regardless of size, in such infrequently-\\ntraded or illiquid swaps may move the market.\\\\197\\\\ GFMA suggested \\ntreating all infrequently-traded swaps as blocks and defines such \\ntransactions as exhibiting all or some of the following features: (1) \\nThe constituent swap or swaps to which they are economically related \\nare not executed on, or pursuant to the rules of, a SEF or DCM; (2) few \\nmarket participants have transacted in these swaps or in economically-\\nrelated swaps; or (3) few swap transactions are executed during a \\nhistoric period in these swaps or in economically-related swaps.\\\\198\\\\ \\nParascandola recommended block treatment for small notional and odd-lot \\ntrades, particularly in index products where the notional amount is \\nbelow $10 million.\\\\199\\\\ Kinetix suggested that transactions in any \\nproduct with fewer than 250 transactions annually should receive \\ntreatment as block trades.\\\\200\\\\ Vanguard urged a more granular approach \\nto swap categories and thresholds to ``recognize distinct liquidity \\npools.\\'\\' \\\\201\\\\ Vanguard and SIFMA suggested that swaps that trade fewer \\nthan 14 trades per day should be blocks.\\\\202\\\\ AII suggested block \\ntreatment for swaps that trade less than 5 times per day.\\\\203\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\192\\\\ CL-Javelin at 5-6; CL-SDMA at 6.\\n    \\\\193\\\\ CL-Barclays at 4.\\n    \\\\194\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\195\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA recommended that every transaction (regardless \\nof size) in a swap category for which there are no more than 14 \\nswaps traded per business day receive block treatment for a period \\nof 1 year. CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 12.\\n    \\\\196\\\\ According to ISDA/SIFMA, ``[f]orcing the same transparency \\nstandards on market participants for both liquid and illiquid \\nproducts will be detrimental. Instantaneous trade disclosure for \\nhighly illiquid products, combined with the potential for SEF or DCM \\nexecution, is likely to erode their liquidity further and to do \\nsevere damage to the safety and soundness of the system as a \\nwhole.\\'\\' Id.\\n    \\\\197\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\198\\\\ CL-GFMA at 3.\\n    \\\\199\\\\ CL-Parascondola at 1.\\n    \\\\200\\\\ CL-Kinetix at 1.\\n    \\\\201\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 5.\\n    \\\\202\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 10; CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n    \\\\203\\\\ CL-AII at 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting the swap categories described in the sections above. The \\nCommission believes that the trade frequency of a single instrument is \\nbut one measure of liquidity for such a swap and does not factor in the \\npool of instruments that are capable of providing an economically \\nequivalent position, either individually or on a portfolio basis.\\n\\nB. Appropriate Minimum Block Size Methodologies for the Initial and \\nPost-Initial Periods\\n\\n    The Commission proposed a tailored approach for determining \\nappropriate minimum block sizes during the initial and post-initial \\nperiods for each asset class. In the subsections below, the Commission \\nsets out a more detailed discussion of the appropriate minimum block \\nsize methodologies for swaps within: (1) Swap categories in the \\ninterest rate and credit asset classes; (2) the single swap category in \\nthe equity asset class; (3) swap categories in the FX asset class; and \\n(4) swap categories in the other commodity asset class. Thereafter, the \\nCommission discusses special rules for determining the appropriate \\nminimum block sizes across asset classes.\\n\\n[[Page 32890]]\\n\\n1. Phase-In of Appropriate Minimum Block Sizes\\n    As discussed in Section I.C.2. above, the Commission proposed a \\nphase-in of its regulations regarding appropriate minimum block size \\nmethodologies so that market participants could better adjust their \\nswap trading strategies to manage risk, secure new technologies, and \\nmake necessary arrangements to comply with part 43. Thus, the \\nCommission proposed two provisions relating to the Commission\\'s \\ndetermination of appropriate minimum block sizes: (1) Initial \\nappropriate minimum block sizes under proposed Sec.  43.6(e); and (2) \\npost-initial appropriate minimum block sizes under proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(f).\\n    The Commission received ten comments regarding the proposed phase-\\nin of its appropriate minimum block size methodologies. Four \\ncommenters, AII, EEI, SIFMA, and Vanguard, requested that the \\nCommission apply block status to all swaps during the initial \\nperiod.\\\\204\\\\ AII stated that removing (or lowering) block thresholds \\nwould appropriately transition the market and avoid harming \\nliquidity.\\\\205\\\\ SIFMA recommended collecting SDR data during the \\ninitial period and gradually and iteratively phasing in block \\nthresholds.\\\\206\\\\ Vanguard also expressed concern regarding the \\nliquidity impacts of setting block thresholds without more data.\\\\207\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\204\\\\ CL-AII at 3; CL-EEI at 5; CL-SIFMA at 3; CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n    \\\\205\\\\ CL-AII at 3.\\n    \\\\206\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 3.\\n    \\\\207\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Eight commenters suggested that the Commission establish a more \\nconservative threshold during the initial period. AII recommended that \\nthe Commission either remove block trading thresholds during the \\ninitial period or lower the thresholds below the proposed levels to \\nappropriately transition the market and avoid unnecessarily harming \\nliquidity.\\\\208\\\\ Barclays recommended introducing block levels that \\nallow for empirical analysis of the transaction data and sequentially \\nincreasing block sizes until such point as the desired equilibrium \\nbetween transparency and liquidity is reached.\\\\209\\\\ GFMA stated that, \\nif the Commission used a percentage notional test, then it should \\nintroduce it in a phased manner to assess the impact on the market over \\ntime and ensure it has sufficient flexibility to amend the notional \\npercentage.\\\\210\\\\ ICAP Energy proposed specific initial block thresholds \\nfor PJM at 50 MW/Hr and for SP-15 and Mid-C at 30 MW/Hr, and for \\nnatural gas basis swaps at 2500 MMBTUs/day.\\\\211\\\\ ICI, while supporting \\na 50 percent notional amount calculation, urged the Commission to \\nphase-in the calculation for very illiquid instruments (less than 3 or \\n4 trades per week) by first implementing a 25 percent notional amount \\ncalculation, in order to alleviate potential harmful effects of \\ndisclosure of large block sizes on liquidity, particularly in illiquid \\nswaps markets.\\\\212\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA stated that the Commission should phase \\nin the block threshold in order to allow trading on SEFs and DCMs to \\ndevelop and suggested setting the threshold based on a 25-percent \\nnotional amount calculation.\\\\213\\\\ SIFMA proposed a multi-phase process \\nfor establishing block levels, starting with a one-year data collection \\nphase, followed by an initial period with low block levels.\\\\214\\\\ The \\nblock levels would then be decreased if the Commission found that \\nliquidity significantly decreased or bid-ask spreads significantly \\nincreased over the quarter for swaps close to, but below, the block \\nthreshold.\\\\215\\\\ WMBAA encouraged the Commission to implement lower \\nblock trade thresholds while the post-trade reporting requirements are \\nimplemented and market participants begin providing data to SDRs for \\ncleared and uncleared swaps.\\\\216\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\208\\\\ CL-AII at 3.\\n    \\\\209\\\\ CL-Barclays at 11.\\n    \\\\210\\\\ CL-GFMA at 3.\\n    \\\\211\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 3.\\n    \\\\212\\\\ CL-ICI at 7.\\n    \\\\213\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 13.\\n    \\\\214\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 3.\\n    \\\\215\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\216\\\\ CL-WMBAA at 4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments above, the Commission is \\nadopting a phased-in approach as proposed, but with modifications in \\nresponse to the comments above regarding phasing, as more fully \\ndescribed below.\\n2.

An example of \\nhow the Commission would apply this proposed methodology is set forth \\nin section VII of this final rule.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\239\\\\ See note 85 supra for the definition of publicly \\nreportable swap transaction. Since the Commission proposed to \\ndetermine all appropriate minimum block sizes based on reliable data \\nfor all publicly reportable swap transactions within a specific swap \\ncategory, the Commission does not view the fact that more than one \\nSDR may collect such data as raising any material concerns.\\n    \\\\240\\\\ See proposed amendment to Sec.  43.2 and the discussion \\ninfra in this section.\\n    \\\\241\\\\ For example, if the observed notional amount is \\n$1,250,000, the amount should be increased to $1,300,000.

For the initial period, the Commission is \\nadopting the 50 percent notional amount calculation to determine \\nappropriate minimum block sizes in the interest rate swaps and credit \\nasset classes. The Commission is of the view that this approach \\nprovides for a more gradual phase-in of minimum block sizes as \\nrecommended by numerous commenters. Moreover, this will allow SDRs to \\ncollect at least one year of reliable data for each swap category prior \\nto the application of the higher 67-percent notional amount calculation \\nto determine appropriate minimum block sizes in the post initial \\nperiod, which the Commission is adopting as discussed below.\\n    For the post-initial period, the Commission is adopting Sec.  \\n43.6(f)(1) as proposed. The 67-percent notional amount calculation is \\nintended to ensure that within a swap category, approximately two-\\nthirds of the sum total of all notional amounts are reported on a real-\\ntime basis. This approach would ensure that market participants have a \\ntimely view of a substantial portion of swap transaction and pricing \\ndata to assist them in determining, inter alia, the competitive\\n\\n[[Page 32894]]\\n\\nprice for swaps within a relevant swap category. The Commission \\nanticipates that enhanced price transparency would encourage market \\nparticipants to provide liquidity (e.g., through the posting of bids \\nand offers), particularly when transaction prices move away from the \\ncompetitive price. The Commission also anticipates that enhanced price \\ntransparency would improve market integrity and price discovery, while \\nreducing information asymmetries enjoyed by market makers in \\npredominately opaque swap markets.\\\\285\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\285\\\\ The proposed calculation stands in contrast to the \\nproposed 95th percentile-based distribution test set out in the \\nInitial Proposal. See the discussion in section I.B. of the Further \\nBlock Proposal.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the Commission\\'s view, using the 67-percent notional amount \\ncalculation in the post-initial period also would minimize the \\npotential impact of real-time public reporting on liquidity risk. The \\nCommission views this calculation methodology as an incremental \\napproach to achieve real-time price transparency in swaps markets. The \\nCommission believes that its methodology, in conjunction with the 50-\\npercent notional amount calculation during the initial period, \\nrepresents a tailored approach towards achieving the goal of subjecting \\n``a vast majority\\'\\' of swap transactions to real-time public \\nreporting.\\\\286\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\286\\\\ See note 41 supra. This phased-in approach seeks to \\nimprove transparency while not having a negative impact on market \\nliquidity.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As noted above, CEA section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv) directs the Commission \\nto take into account whether the public disclosure of swap transaction \\nand pricing data ``will materially reduce market liquidity.\\'\\' \\\\287\\\\ If \\nmarket participants conclude that the Commission has set appropriate \\nminimum block sizes for a specific swap category in a way that will \\nmaterially reduce market liquidity, then those participants are \\nencouraged to submit data to support their conclusion. In addition, \\nthrough its own surveillance of swaps market activity, the Commission \\nmay become aware that an appropriate minimum block size would reduce \\nmarket liquidity for a specific swap category.\\\\288\\\\ In response to \\neither a submission or its own surveillance of swaps market activity \\nthe Commission may exercise its legal authority to take action by rule \\nor order to mitigate the potential effects on market liquidity with \\nrespect to swaps in a particular swap category.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\287\\\\ 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(13)(E)(iv).\\n    \\\\288\\\\ The Commission received two comments supporting the \\nCommission\\'s authority to set appropriate minimum block sizes \\noutside of the proposed annual look-back period. MFA argued that the \\nCommission\\'s goal to balance transparency and liquidity would be \\nbetter achieved with the flexibility to adjust minimum block sizes \\nquickly to respond to material market changes. CL-MFA at 8. MFA \\nrecommended that the Commission should have the authority to update \\npost-initial minimum block sizes in extraordinary circumstances and \\non a case-by-case basis, based on SDR data that it receives for \\nindividual or across multiple swap categories. Id. GFMA stated that \\nif the Commission establishes a notional calculation test, then it \\nshould ensure that it has sufficient flexibility to amend minimum \\nblock sizes. CL-GFMA at 4. GFMA recommended that the Commission \\nshould be able to ``swiftly alter\\'\\' block trade levels to enable \\nsome trading to be conducted in a newly illiquid market, without the \\nbenefit of reference to a data set. Id. The Commission notes that \\nSec.  43.6(f)(1) provides that the Commission shall update post-\\ninitial appropriate minimum block levels ``[n]o less than once each \\ncalendar year.\\'\\' Accordingly, the Commission notes that it has the \\nability to adjust post-initial minimum block sizes under the types \\nof extraordinary circumstances raised by commenters.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    With respect to the market depth and market breadth test, the \\nCommission is declining to adopt this approach to determine appropriate \\nminimum block sizes at this time. The Commission considers the test a \\nviable alternative to the notional amount calculation methodology, but \\nalso recognizes several prerequisites to implementing such a test. For \\nexample, the Commission would need to determine which contracts within \\na swap category offer pre-trade price transparency--electronically \\ndisplayed and executable bids and offers as well as displayed available \\nvolumes for execution. As noted by commenters, adequate market trading \\ndata also must be available to collect a market depth snapshot of all \\nof the bids and offers for the pre-trade price transparency set of \\napplicable contracts. The Commission is also cognizant of MFA\\'s \\nconcerns regarding the potential for manipulation of market depth. \\nGiven the time needed for trading infrastructure to develop and the \\nsignificant time and cost considerations involved in collecting such \\ndata from SEFs and DCMs, the Commission will continue to examine the \\nmerits of adopting the market depth and market breadth test.\\n    The Commission is currently of the view that data is per se \\nreliable if it is collected by an SDR for an asset class after the \\nrespective compliance date for such asset class as set forth in part 45 \\nof the Commission\\'s regulations or by other Commission action.

Data for Determination of Appropriate Minimum Block Sizes in the \\nPost-Initial Period\\n    As referenced above in Sec.  43.6(f)(2), the Commission proposed \\ndetermining post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes utilizing a \\nthree-year rolling window (beginning with a minimum of one year and \\nadding one year of data for each calculation until a total of three \\nyears of data is accumulated) of swap transaction and pricing data.\\n    The Commission received eight comments regarding the use of a \\nthree-\\n\\n[[Page 32895]]\\n\\nyear rolling window of data. AII believed it would be more prudent for \\nthe Commission to base block trading thresholds on a shorter time \\nframe, using newer data. AII recommended that the Commission should \\nonly use the highest of the three-year, one-year, or one-quarter data \\ncollected in the determinations.\\\\296\\\\ GFMA stated that the three-year \\nrolling data set is unlikely to be sensitive enough to shorter term \\nchanges in market liquidity and therefore risks setting block sizes \\nthat do not reflect current market conditions.\\\\297\\\\ ICI believed that a \\nthree-year window may not provide an appropriate data set to calculate \\nthe block threshold, and encouraged the Commission to look at a one-\\nyear set of data and a one-quarter set of data to determine whether the \\ncalculation would produce more accurate results.\\\\298\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA \\nrecommended a 6-month window for determining appropriate minimum block \\nsizes, as a three-year rolling window is over-inclusive, particularly \\nin CDS.\\\\299\\\\ Kinetix expressed concern that historical data may not be \\nindicative of current market conditions.\\\\300\\\\ MFA was concerned that \\nthe three-year window would constrain the ability to shorten the look-\\nback period if material changes in market conditions warranted a \\nsmaller data set, and recommended retaining the option to shorten the \\nlook-back window for the observed data set.\\\\301\\\\ SIFMA believed that \\nblock reassessments should look to data on swaps executed since the \\nprevious reassessment, rather than from a three-year data window as \\nproposed by the Commission.\\\\302\\\\ Vanguard believed the assessment \\nshould be made on the basis of data recorded over a rolling three-month \\nperiod for each swaps category.\\\\303\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\296\\\\ CL-AII at 11.\\n    \\\\297\\\\ CL-GFMA at 4.\\n    \\\\298\\\\ CL-ICI at 7-8.\\n    \\\\299\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 14.\\n    \\\\300\\\\ CL-Kinetix at 1.\\n    \\\\301\\\\ CL-MFA at 8.\\n    \\\\302\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 6-7.\\n    \\\\303\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(f)(2) with modifications. Based upon the numerous \\ncomments recommending a data set covering a shorter time frame, the \\nCommission will determine post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes \\nunder Sec.  43.6(f)(2) utilizing a one-year window of swap transaction \\nand pricing data. This approach will allow the Commission to better \\ncalibrate block thresholds to changes in market liquidity, while at the \\nsame time providing enough data to smooth out fluctuations in data such \\nas those that may result from, for example, seasonality.\\n    As referenced above, the Commission proposed to amend Sec.  43.2 of \\nthe Commission\\'s regulations to define the term ``trimmed data set\\'\\' as \\na data set that has had extraordinarily large notional transactions \\nremoved by transforming the data into a logarithm with a base of ten \\n(Log<INF>10</INF>), computing the mean, and excluding transactions that \\nare beyond four standard deviations above the mean. Proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(c) uses this term in connection with the calculations that the \\nCommission would undertake in determining appropriate minimum block \\nsizes and cap sizes.\\n    The Commission received five comments regarding the proposed use of \\na trimmed data set. Three commenters supported the use of a trimmed \\ndata set, but suggested alternative approaches. ISDA/SIFMA opposed the \\nproposed methodology and believed that it would establish a threshold \\nthat is too high to exclude large transactions.\\\\304\\\\ Therefore, ISDA/\\nSIFMA recommended that the Commission look instead at the raw block \\nsize (calculated based on all transactions in the relevant swap \\ncategory) and eliminate any trades more than five times larger than the \\nblock threshold.\\\\305\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA alternatively recommended that the \\nCommission only exclude transactions that are three standard deviations \\nbeyond the mean because the proposed methodology (excluding \\ntransactions that are four standard deviations beyond the mean) would \\ncapture large transactions that would otherwise skew the data.\\\\306\\\\ For \\npurposes of applying a market depth and market breadth test, Javelin \\nand SDMA recommended trimming each data set to focus only on bids or \\noffers at the ``current price\\'\\'--the Commission would (1) determine the \\nmid-point of the bid-offer spread; (2) capture orders between the bid \\nand this value; and (3) capture orders between the offer and this \\nvalue.\\\\307\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\304\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 14.\\n    \\\\305\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\306\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\307\\\\ CL-Javelin at 5; CL-SDMA at 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Two commenters opposed data trimming on the grounds that it is \\nirrelevant to the purpose of determining minimum block trade sizes. AFR \\nand Better Markets believed that trimming the data set would ultimately \\nskew minimum block size calculations, such that certain-sized trades \\nwould be classified as block trades.\\\\308\\\\ Better Markets stated that \\nthe Commission should disclose the discrepancies between using a \\ntrimmed data set versus an unfiltered data set to calculate the block \\nsize threshold because the public lacks the data to make this \\ndetermination on its own.\\\\309\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\308\\\\ CL-AFR at 7; CL-Better Markets at 9.\\n    \\\\309\\\\ CL-Better Markets at 9.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.2 as proposed and applying the concept of a trimmed \\ndata set in Sec.  43.6(c) as proposed. The Commission believes that \\nremoving the largest transactions, but not the smallest transactions, \\nmay provide a better data set for establishing the appropriate minimum \\nblock size, given that the smallest transactions may reflect liquidity \\navailable to offset large transactions. Moreover, in the context of \\nsetting a block trade level (or large notional off-facility swap \\nlevel), a method to determine relatively large swap transactions should \\nbe distinguished from a method to determine extraordinarily large \\ntransactions; the latter may skew measures of the central tendency of \\ntransaction size (i.e., transactions of usual size) away from a more \\nrepresentative value of the center.\\\\310\\\\ Therefore, trimming the data \\nset increases the power of these statistical measures. In response to \\nthe commenters who oppose data trimming, the Commission emphasizes that \\ntrimming the data set is necessary to avoid the skewing of these \\nmeasures, which could lead to the establishment of inappropriately high \\nminimum block sizes.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\310\\\\ A measure of central tendency, also known as a measure of \\nlocation, in a distribution is a single value that represents the \\ntypical transaction size. Two such measures are the mean and the \\nmedian. For a general discussion of statistical methods, see e.g., \\nWilcox, R. R., Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods (Springer \\n2d ed. 2010), (2010).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n5. Methodology for Determining the Appropriate Minimum Block Sizes by \\nAsset Class\\na. Interest Rate and Credit Default Swaps\\n    As described above, the Commission proposed using a 67-percent \\nnotional amount calculation to determine appropriate minimum block \\nsizes for swaps in the interest rate and credit asset classes in both \\nthe initial and post-initial periods pursuant to Sec. Sec.  43.6(c)(1), \\n43.6(e)(1), and 43.6(f)(1). There was an exception to the use of the \\n67-percent notional amount calculation for the initial period in three \\nswap categories in the interest rate and credit asset classes which \\ncontained less than 30 transactions that would meet the definition of \\npublicly reportable swap transaction: (1) Interest rate swap\\n\\n[[Page 32896]]\\n\\ncategory--major currency/30 years +; (2) interest rate swap category--\\nnon-major currency/30 years +; and (3) CDScategory--350 bps +/6 to 8.5 \\nyears. If the Commission were to use the proposed 67 percent notional \\ncalculation method, then two of the three swap categories would have \\nresulted in appropriate minimum block sizes higher than those proposed. \\nThe remaining swap category contained no data. Accordingly, for these \\nthree swap categories in the initial period, the Commission proposed \\nusing the lowest appropriate minimum block size for their respective \\nasset classes based on the respective data set.\\\\311\\\\ In the interest \\nrate asset class, the swap category with the lowest block size was the \\nnon-major currency/5 to 10 years, with an appropriate minimum block \\nsize of $22 million (USD). In the credit asset class, the swap category \\nwith the lowest block size was the category 350 bps +/8.5 to 12.5 \\nyears, with an appropriate minimum block size of $21 million (USD). \\nHence, the appropriate minimum block size was proposed to be set at $22 \\nmillion (USD) for the two interest rate swap categories with \\ninsufficient data and at $21 million (USD) for the corresponding CDS \\ncategory.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\311\\\\ 77 FR at 15480.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For interest rate swaps specifically, the Commission received eight \\ncomments regarding the application of the 67 percent notional amount \\ncalculation to determine initial and post-initial minimum block sizes. \\nJefferies supported the Commission\\'s proposal, stating that the 67 \\npercent notional amount calculation was consistent with congressional \\nintent and observed liquidity.\\\\312\\\\ FIA did not explicitly support the \\n67 percent notional amount calculation, but stated that a 50 percent \\nnotional amount calculation for interest rate swaps would be \\nsignificantly too low.\\\\313\\\\ Javelin, ODEX, SDMA, and Spring Trading all \\nrecommended that the Commission maintain the proposed 67 percent \\nnotional amount calculation or raise the threshold higher.\\\\314\\\\ Javelin \\nand SDMA both suggested a 75 percent notional amount calculation in \\nconjunction with a market breadth and market depth approach.\\\\315\\\\ Other \\ncommenters, however, suggested lower values for the notional amount \\ncalculation--Freddie recommended a 50 percent notional calculation in \\nthe absence of more comprehensive data about liquidity and depth of \\nswaps markets.\\\\316\\\\ Pierpont commented that, for instances where one \\ncounterparty to a swap is not a registered swap dealer, the Commission \\nshould determine block levels based on a 25 percent notional amount \\ncalculation.\\\\317\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\312\\\\ CL-Javelin at 1-2.\\n    \\\\313\\\\ CL-FIA at 2.\\n    \\\\314\\\\ CL-Javelin at 2; CL-ODEX at 1; CL-SDMA at 2; CL-Spring \\nTrading at 2.\\n    \\\\315\\\\ CL-Javelin at 2; CL-SDMA at 2.\\n    \\\\316\\\\ CL-Freddie at 2.\\n    \\\\317\\\\ CL-Pierpont at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For credit default swaps, the Commission received four comments \\nregarding the application of the 67 percent notional amount calculation \\nto determine initial and post-initial minimum block sizes.

AII commented that the data for interest rate swaps and \\nCDS is no longer reflective of the market, nor is it reflective of the \\nmarket that will result once the Commission\\'s regulations are \\nimplemented in full, and urged the Commission not to rely on minimal \\nand outdated data.\\\\321\\\\ ICI stated that the historical data on which \\nthe Commission relies may not be reflective of the swaps market once \\nthe Dodd-Frank Act requirements are fully implemented.\\\\322\\\\ Freddie \\nstated that the interest rate data set may not be comprehensive enough \\nto form the basis of the proposed minimum block sizes, particularly \\nwhere the proposed post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes are \\ndetermined after transaction and pricing data has been collected for a \\nyear.\\\\323\\\\ ICAP recommended that, if the Commission relies on \\nhistorical market data, then it should use data that is more current \\nand demonstrated to be representative of the market.\\\\324\\\\ MFA stated \\nthat, given limitations related to the size, composition, and \\ntimeliness of the data set that the Commission used for the initial \\nperiod, the Commission should calibrate initial minimum block sizes \\nagainst current market conditions.\\\\325\\\\ Vanguard stated that block \\nthresholds cannot be established absent an adequate data source and \\ntime for assessment.\\\\326\\\\ WMBAA believed that, in basing rules on three \\nmonths of data from over two years ago, the Commission has failed to \\n``examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \\nfor its action including a rational connection between the facts found \\nand the choices made\\'\\' as well as ``determine as best it can the \\neconomic implications of the rule.\\'\\' \\\\327\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\321\\\\ CL-AII at 7.\\n    \\\\322\\\\ CL-ICI at 5.\\n    \\\\323\\\\ CL-Freddie at 2.\\n    \\\\324\\\\ CL-ICAP at 8.\\n    \\\\325\\\\ CL-MFA at 6-7.\\n    \\\\326\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n    \\\\327\\\\ CL-WMBAA at 4-5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As described more fully above, in response to comments regarding \\nthe data sets used for interest rate and credit default swaps, the use \\nof an incremental approach, and the comments regarding phasing and the \\n67-percent notional amount calculation regardless of asset class, the \\nCommission is adopting a phased-in approach to notional amount \\ncalculation. The Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(e)(1) and (f)(1) as \\nproposed, with modifications. In the initial period, the Commission is \\nadopting the 50-percent notional amount calculation to determine \\nappropriate minimum block sizes in the interest rate and credit asset \\nclasses. The Commission believes that this approach provides for a more \\ngradual phase-in of minimum block sizes, as explained more fully \\nabove.\\\\328\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\328\\\\ See supra Section II.B(3).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission did not receive any comments regarding the exception \\nto the 67 percent notional amount calculation for swap categories \\ncontaining fewer than 30 transactions. Accordingly, the Commission will \\ncontinue to apply this exception in instances where the a Interest Rate \\nor Credit swap category contains fewer than 30 transactions in \\ncalculating appropriate minimum block thresholds for the initial \\nperiod.\\nb. Equity\\n    The Commission proposed under Sec.  43.6(d) that all swaps in the \\nequity asset class would not qualify for treatment as a block trade or \\nlarge notional off-facility swap (i.e., these swaps would not be \\nsubject to a reporting time delay under part 43). As noted above, the \\nCommission proposed this approach based on (1) the existence of a \\nhighly liquid underlying cash market; (2) the absence of time delays \\nfor reporting block trades in the underlying equity cash market; (3) \\nthe\\n\\n[[Page 32897]]\\n\\nsmall relative size of the equity swaps market relative to the futures, \\noptions and cash equity index markets; and (4) the Commission\\'s goal to \\nprotect the price discovery function of the underlying equity cash \\nmarket and futures market.\\n    The Commission received six comments regarding swap categories in \\nthe equity asset class. One commenter, AFR, felt that no block trade \\ntreatment is appropriate as proposed for the equity asset class.\\\\329\\\\ \\nFive other commenters recommended that the Commission treat equity \\nswaps similarly to the other asset classes and establish swap \\ncategories based upon a range of criteria.\\\\330\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\329\\\\ CL-AFR at 6.\\n    \\\\330\\\\ CL-AII at 9; CL-Barclays at 9; CL-ICI at; ISDA/SIFMA at \\n10-11; SIFMA at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    AII disagreed with the Commission\\'s proposal that no equity swaps \\nshould be treated as blocks and suggested harmonization with the SEC\\'s \\napproach for large equity trades.\\\\331\\\\ Barclays also disagreed with \\ndisallowing block levels for all equity swaps and recommended that the \\nequity asset class should be treated similarly to the other asset \\nclasses, such that broad based indices should have separate block \\nlevels based upon futures market levels.\\\\332\\\\ Barclays also suggested \\nthat the Commission coordinate with the SEC in setting minimum block \\nlevels.\\\\333\\\\ ICI recommended interim time delays for all equity swaps \\nuntil a closer study of data on equity swap transactions is completed, \\ndue to potential differences in liquidity in the underlying equity cash \\nmarket.\\\\334\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA requested that the Commission reconsider its \\nproposal and suggested that the Commission establish block sizes based \\non the consideration of total trading volume of swaps linked to the \\nrelevant underlying index or basket of equity securities.\\\\335\\\\ SIFMA \\nstated that the Commission should establish appropriate minimum block \\nsizes for equity swaps based upon liquidity of the underlying \\nindices.\\\\336\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\331\\\\ CL-AII at 9.\\n    \\\\332\\\\ CL-Barclays at 9.\\n    \\\\333\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\334\\\\ CL-ICI at 5.\\n    \\\\335\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 10-11.\\n    \\\\336\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(d) as proposed. While a number of the commenters \\npointed out differences in liquidity in the underlying equity indices \\nas a justification for swap categorization, these differences do not \\nalter the premises underlying the Commission\\'s proposal. Even taking \\nthese differences into account, there is still (1) a highly liquid \\nunderlying cash market; and (2) a small equity swaps market relative to \\nthe futures, options, and cash equity index markets. These \\ncharacteristics, combined with the fact that there are no time delays \\nfor reporting block trades in the underlying equity cash market, makes \\nestablishment of swap categories and block thresholds for equity swaps \\ninappropriate.\\\\337\\\\ Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec.  \\n43.6(d) as proposed.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\337\\\\ In the event that time delays are established for \\nreporting block trades in the underlying equity cash market, the \\nCommission may consider establishing swap categories and block \\nthresholds for equity swaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nc. FX\\n    The Commission proposed to use different methodologies for the \\ninitial and post-initial periods to determine appropriate minimum block \\nsizes for swaps categories in the FX asset class. The Commission\\'s \\nproposed approach is premised on the absence of actual market data on \\nwhich to determine appropriate minimum block sizes in the initial \\nperiod. Subsection a. below includes a discussion of the initial period \\nmethodology. Subsection ii. below includes a discussion of the post-\\ninitial period methodology.\\ni. Initial Period Methodology\\n    The Commission proposed under Sec.  43.6(e)(1) to set the \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for swaps in the FX asset class during \\nthe initial period based on whether such swap is economically related \\nto a futures contract, i.e., a futures-related swap.\\\\338\\\\ For futures-\\nrelated swaps in the FX asset class, proposed Sec.  43.6(e)(1) provides \\nthat the Commission would establish the appropriate minimum block sizes \\nbased on the block trade size thresholds set by DCMs for economically-\\nrelated futures contracts.\\\\339\\\\ The Commission set forth the initial \\nappropriate minimum block sizes in proposed appendix F to part 43 of \\nthe Commission\\'s regulations.\\\\340\\\\ For non-futures related swaps in the \\nFX asset class in the initial period, the Commission proposed under \\nSec.  43.6(e)(2) that all such swaps would qualify to be treated as \\nblock trades or large notional off-facility swaps (i.e., these swaps \\nwould be subject to a time delay under part 43 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations). The Commission expected that this provision, as provided, \\nonly would apply to the most illiquid swaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\338\\\\ See supra note 169.\\n    \\\\339\\\\ For example, if swap A is economically related to futures \\nF, and futures F is subject to the block trade rules of a DCM that \\napplies at a notional amount of $1 million, then swap A would \\nqualify for treatment as a block trade or large notional off-\\nfacility swap if the notional amount of swap A exceeds $1 million.\\n    \\\\340\\\\ In situations when two or more DCMs offer for trading \\nfutures contracts that are economically related, the Commission has \\nselected the lowest applicable non-zero futures block size as the \\ninitial appropriate minimum block size. The Commission believes that \\nthis approach would reduce the chance that the appropriate minimum \\nblock size established by the Commission in the initial period would \\nhave an unintended adverse effect on market liquidity for the \\nrelevant swap category.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received three comments specifically related to the \\nproposed methodology for determining appropriate minimum block sizes \\nfor swap categories in the FX asset class during the initial period. \\nSDMA supported the Commission\\'s proposed block trade thresholds for the \\nFX asset class.\\\\341\\\\ AII, however, urged the Commission to consider \\nremoving the block trading threshold during the initial period for the \\nFX asset class, so as to allow the Commission to use SDR data to \\nproperly evaluate the market.\\\\342\\\\ ICAP recommended an initial block \\nlevel of $10 million in the 1-month contract on a variety of FX non-\\ndeliverable forward contracts.\\\\343\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\341\\\\ CL-SDMA at 2.\\n    \\\\342\\\\ CL-AII at 3 n.10.\\n    \\\\343\\\\ CL-ICAP at 10.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission notes that, since the Further Block Proposal, \\nTreasury has issued a Final Determination, pursuant to sections \\n1a(47)(E)(i) and 1b of the CEA, that exempts FX swaps and FX forwards \\nfrom the definition of ``swap\\'\\' under the CEA. Therefore, the \\nrequirements of section 2(a)(13) of the CEA would not apply to those \\ntransactions, and such transactions would not be subject to part 43 of \\nthe Commission\\'s regulations.\\\\344\\\\ Nevertheless, section 1a(47)(E)(iii) \\nof the CEA provides that FX swaps and FX forwards transactions still \\nare not excluded from regulatory reporting requirements to an SDR. \\nFurther, the Commission notes that Treasury\\'s final determination \\nexcludes FX swaps and FX forwards, but does not apply to FX options or \\nnon-deliverable FX forwards. As such, FX instruments that are not \\ncovered by Treasury\\'s final determination are subject to part 43 of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\344\\\\ See Determination of Foreign Exchange Swaps and Foreign \\nExchange Forwards under the Commodity Exchange Act, 77 FR 69694, \\nNov. 20, 2012.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(e)(1) and (2) as proposed. However, given the \\nchanges to proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i), which significantly reduce the \\nnumber of swap categories, the Commission believes that this approach \\nencompasses the most liquid FX swaps and instruments, including all\\n\\n[[Page 32898]]\\n\\nsuper-major currency combinations, as well as all super-major and major \\ncurrency combinations. This approach further encompasses many important \\nsuper-major and non-major currency combinations, many of which already \\nhave block trade size thresholds set by DCMs for economically-related \\nfutures contracts.\\\\345\\\\ The Commission believes that this approach is \\nappropriate during the initial period in the absence of actual swap \\ndata. The approach during the initial period would draw upon the \\nexperience of DCMs in considering the potential impacts on liquidity \\nrisk that enhanced transparency may cause in connection with futures \\ncontract execution.\\\\346\\\\ The Commission understands that DCMs have set \\nblock sizes primarily in consideration of the objectives of enhancing \\npre-trade transparency and reducing liquidity risk.\\\\347\\\\ The Commission \\nnotes that DCMs are required to set block sizes for futures in \\ncompliance with relevant core principles (including Core Principle 9) \\n\\\\348\\\\ and Commission regulations.\\\\349\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\345\\\\ See Q18 of the Further Block Proposal, which sets forth an \\nalternative approach to proposed swap categories based on unique \\ncurrency combinations. 77 FR 15476.\\n    \\\\346\\\\ The Commission notes further that DCMs historically have \\nhad the appropriate incentive to balance these considerations \\nbecause they benefit from liquidity generally (i.e., commissions \\nfrom transaction volume in block and non-block trades provides DCMs \\nwith their primary source of revenue).\\n    \\\\347\\\\ The Commission is of the view that the pre-trade and post-\\ntrade contexts are sufficiently similar such that policies directed \\nat balancing transparency and liquidity concerns in a pre-trade \\ncontext are relevant in considering what an appropriate balance is \\nin the post-trade context. In the pre-trade context, block sizes are \\nset near or at the point where a trader would be able to offset the \\nrisk of an equally large transaction without bearing liquidity risk.\\n    \\\\348\\\\ Core Principle 9 of section 5(d) of the CEA provides that \\na DCM ``shall provide a competitive, open, and efficient market and \\nmechanism for executing transactions. . . . \\'\\' 7 U.S.C. 7(d)(9). \\nCurrent appendix B to part 38 of the Commission\\'s regulations \\nprovides that in order to maintain compliance with Core Principle 9, \\nDCMs allowing block trading ``should ensure that the block trading \\ndoes not operate in a manner that compromises the integrity of \\nprices or price discovery on the relevant market.\\'\\' See 17 CFR 38 \\napp. B.\\n    \\\\349\\\\ For example, section 40.6 of the Commission\\'s regulations \\ninclude a process by which registered entities may certify rules or \\nrule amendments that establish or change block trade sizes for \\nfutures contracts. See 17 CFR 40.6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nii. Post-Initial Period Methodology\\n    In the post-initial period, the Commission proposed under Sec.  \\n43.6(f)(2) to utilize the 67 percent notional amount calculation to \\ndetermine appropriate minimum block sizes for swap categories in the FX \\nasset class. The Commission would group all publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions in the FX asset class into their respective swap \\ncategories and then apply the 67 percent notional amount calculation to \\ndetermine the appropriate minimum block sizes.\\n    The Commission received three comments specific to the proposed \\nmethodology for determining appropriate minimum block sizes for swap \\ncategories in the FX asset class during the post-initial period. SDMA \\nsupported the Commission\\'s proposed block trade thresholds for the FX \\nasset class.\\\\350\\\\ Barclays and GFMA, however, expressed concern that \\nthe 67 percent notional amount calculation was proposed without actual \\nswap data regarding the FX asset class.\\\\351\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\350\\\\ CL-SDMA at 2.\\n    \\\\351\\\\ CL-Barclays at 10; CL-GFMA at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(f)(2) with the modification that only those swap \\ncategories established in Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) will have minimum block \\nsizes set using this methodology in the post-initial period, while the \\nremainder of the swaps covered by Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(ii) will continue to \\nbe treated as blocks. The Commission believes that applying the 67 \\npercent notional amount calculation will ensure that the vast majority \\nof swap transactions are subject to real-time reporting.\\\\352\\\\ In \\naddition, applying the 67 percent notional amount calculation to all \\nfive asset classes in the post-initial period provides a consistent, \\nbright-line rule regarding how appropriate minimum block thresholds \\nwill be calculated, thus providing clarity to market participants \\nengaging in swap transactions. By allowing all swaps covered by Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(4)(ii) to be treated as blocks, the Commission is being \\nconservative in its approach in potentially less liquid markets where \\nthe impacts to market participants of inappropriate block trades could \\nbe substantial. The Commission believes that this approach provides \\nadditional time to analyze data in order to establish improved swap \\ncategories as suggested by commenters.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\352\\\\ See supra note 256.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nd. Other Commodity\\n    The Commission proposed using different methodologies for the \\ninitial and post-initial periods to determine appropriate minimum block \\nsizes for swaps categories in the other commodity asset class. The \\nproposed methodology for determining the appropriate minimum block \\nsizes in the initial period differs based on the three types of other \\ncommodity swap categories: (1) Those swaps based on contracts listed in \\nappendix B to part 43 of the Commission\\'s regulations; \\\\353\\\\ (2) swaps \\nthat are economically related to certain futures contracts; \\\\354\\\\ and \\n(3) other swaps.\\\\355\\\\ With regards to (1), the Commission proposed \\nsetting initial appropriate minimum block sizes for publicly reportable \\nswap transactions in which the underlying asset directly references or \\nis economically related to the natural gas or electricity swap \\ncontracts listed in appendix B to part 43 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations.\\\\356\\\\ The proposed methodology for determining the \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for other commodity swaps in the post-\\ninitial period follows the same methodology--the 67 percent notional \\namount methodology--used for determining the post-initial appropriate \\nminimum block sizes in the interest rate, credit and FX asset classes. \\nA more detailed description of the methodologies during the initial and \\npost-initial periods, as well as the rules for the special treatment of \\nlisted natural gas and electricity swaps are presented in the \\nsubsections below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\353\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i). The Commission is \\nadopting most of the proposed categories in this final rule, subject \\nto some modifications. See supra note 190 and accompanying text.\\n    \\\\354\\\\ As proposed under Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(ii), these futures \\ncontracts were: CME Cheese; CBOT Distillers\\' Dried Grain; CBOT Dow \\nJones-UBS Commodity Index Excess Return; CBOT Ethanol; CME Frost \\nIndex; CME Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) (GSCI Excess Return \\nIndex); NYMEX Gulf Coast Gasoline; Gulf Coast Sour Crude Oil; NYMEX \\nGulf Coast Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel; CME Hurricane Index; CME \\nInternational Skimmed Milk Powder; NYMEX New York Harbor Ultra Low \\nSulfur Diesel; CBOT Nonfarm Payroll; CME Rainfall Index; CME \\nSnowfall Index; CME Temperature Index; CME U.S. Dollar Cash Settled \\nCrude Palm Oil; and CME Wood Pulp. The Commission is adopting most \\nof the proposed categories in this final rule, subject to some \\nmodifications. See supra note 187.\\n    \\\\355\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(iii).\\n    \\\\356\\\\ The Commission notes that pursuant to proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(i), each of the listed natural gas and electricity swap \\ncontracts proposed to be listed in appendix B to part 43 would be \\nconsidered its own swap category. As discussed further above, the \\nCommission is adopting these categories in this final rule. See \\nsupra Section II.A(4).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\ni. Initial Period Methodology\\n    With respect to swaps that reference or are economically related to \\none of the futures contracts listed in appendix B to part 43 \\\\357\\\\ or \\nin Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(ii), the Commission proposed to set the appropriate \\nminimum block size based on the block sizes for related futures\\n\\n[[Page 32899]]\\n\\ncontracts set by DCMs.\\\\358\\\\ Similar to its rationale with respect to \\nsetting initial appropriate minimum block sizes for swaps in the FX \\nasset class, the Commission believed that this approach would utilize \\nthe experience of DCMs in considering liquidity effects of enhancing \\npre-trade transparency in setting block sizes for these contracts. For \\nswaps that reference or are economically related to a futures contract \\nlisted in appendix B to part 43 that is not subject to a DCM block \\ntrade rule, the Commission proposed in Sec.  43.6(e)(3) to disallow \\ntreatment as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. The \\nCommission based this approach on an inference that DCMs have not set \\nblock trade rules for certain futures contracts because of the degree \\nof liquidity in those futures markets.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\357\\\\ The futures contracts that are currently listed on \\nappendix B to part 43 are the 28 Enumerated Reference Contracts plus \\nBrent Crude Oil (ICE). The 13 electricity and natural gas swap \\ncontracts that the Commission had proposed to add to appendix B to \\npart 43 of the Commission\\'s regulations were not futures contracts. \\nAs noted above, however, these contracts have been converted into \\neconomically equivalent futures contracts that are listed on a DCM. \\nSee supra note 176.\\n    \\\\358\\\\ In situations when two or more DCMs offer for trading \\nfutures contracts that are economically related, the Commission has \\nselected the lowest applicable non-zero futures block size among the \\nDCMs as the initial appropriate minimum block size. The Commission \\nbelieves that this approach would reduce the chance that the \\nappropriate minimum block size established by the Commission in the \\ninitial period would have an unintended adverse effect on market \\nliquidity for the relevant swap category.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the initial period, the Commission proposed in Sec.  43.6(e)(2) \\nto treat all non-futures-related swaps \\\\359\\\\ in the other commodity \\nasset class as block trades or large notional off-facility swaps (i.e., \\nthese swaps would be subject to a reporting time delay under part 43, \\nirrespective of notional amount). The Commission believed that non-\\nfutures-related swaps in the other commodity asset class generally have \\nlower liquidity in contrast to the more liquid interest rate, credit \\nand equity asset classes, as well as other commodity swaps that are \\neconomically related to liquid futures contracts (i.e., those futures \\ncontracts listed in appendix B to part 43).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\359\\\\ These non-futures related swaps are not economically \\nrelated to one of the futures contracts listed in proposed appendix \\nB to part 43 or in proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(ii). See proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b)(5)(iii).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission also proposed to amend appendix B to part 43 of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations to add 13 natural gas and electricity swap \\ncontracts, which the Commission previously has determined to be liquid \\ncontracts serving a price discovery function,\\\\360\\\\ with each contract \\nserving as the basis for a swap category in the other commodity asset \\nclass. The Commission further proposed to set the initial appropriate \\nminimum block size for each of these categories to $25 million (USD), \\nwhich would apply to natural gas and electricity swaps that reference \\nor are economically related to these natural gas and electricity swap \\ncontracts.\\\\361\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\360\\\\ See supra Section II.A(4).\\n    \\\\361\\\\ For swaps in which the underlying asset references or is \\neconomically related to one of the natural gas or electricity swaps, \\nthe Commission proposed to treat such natural gas and electricity \\nswaps differently than other publicly reportable swap transactions \\nin the other commodity asset class when setting the initial \\nappropriate minimum block sizes. The Commission recognized that \\ntraders typically offset their positions in the natural gas and \\nelectricity markets through trading OTC forward contracts, swaps, \\nplain vanilla options, non-standard options and other customized \\narrangements since existing futures contracts listed on DCMs only \\ncover a limited number of electricity delivery points. The proposed \\n$25 million initial minimum block level corresponded to the level of \\nthe interim and initial cap sizes. For a discussion of interim and \\ninitial cap sizes, see supra section III.A of the Further Block \\nProposal.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    SDMA expressed support for the proposed methodology for swaps in \\nthe other commodity asset class.\\\\362\\\\ With respect to the swaps in \\nwhich the underlying asset references or is economically related to one \\nof the natural gas or electricity swaps listed in appendix B to part \\n43, EEI also expressed support for denominating the minimum block size \\nin U.S. dollars, rather than by a quantity such as Mwh.\\\\363\\\\ EEI argued \\nthat denominating minimum block sizes in U.S. dollars would promote \\nstandardization across the various trading hubs in the electricity and \\nnatural gas markets.\\\\364\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\362\\\\ CL-SDMA at 2 n.1.\\n    \\\\363\\\\ CL-EEI at 11 n. 29.\\n    \\\\364\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters, however, objected to certain aspects of the \\nproposed $25 million (USD) initial appropriate minimum block size. Two \\ncommenters recommended setting the block sizes based on mmBtu/day and \\nMW/hr for natural gas and electricity swaps, respectively, rather than \\nsetting the block sizes based on notional amount.\\\\365\\\\ ICAP Energy \\ncommented in particular that adopting the latter approach would be \\ninappropriate, given that prices for such commodities fluctuate due to \\npeak season usage or delivery location.\\\\366\\\\ ICAP Energy also commented \\nthat it was not clear as to how the notional value of swaps with \\noptionality would be calculated; calculating notional value based on \\nthe premium of the option, for example, would adversely affect low-\\npremium options such as out-of-the-money calls and puts.\\\\367\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\365\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 4; CL-Barclays at 9.\\n    \\\\366\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 4.\\n    \\\\367\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Two commenters opposed the proposed $25 million (USD) initial \\nminimum block size with respect to the swap categories for the \\nelectricity swaps added to appendix B to part 43. ICAP Energy and EEI \\nargued that the proposed limits were too high given the relative \\nilliquidity of these markets.\\\\368\\\\ ICAP Energy recommended the \\nfollowing minimum block sizes: PJM WH (on-peak and off-peak)--50 MW/hr; \\nSP-15 Financial Day-Ahead LMP (on-peak and off-peak)--30/MW/hr; Mid-C \\nFinancial (on-peak and off-peak--30 MW/hr).\\\\369\\\\ EEI requested that the \\nCommission treat all electricity swaps transactions as block trades \\nduring the initial period or, in the alternative, set the initial \\nminimum block size at no higher than $3 million.\\\\370\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\368\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 5; CL-EEI at 5.\\n    \\\\369\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 5.\\n    \\\\370\\\\ CL-EEI at 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ICAP Energy and EEI also opposed the proposed $25 million initial \\nminimum block size with respect to the swap categories for the natural \\ngas swaps proposed to be added to appendix B to part 43. EEI requested \\nthat the Commission treat all natural gas swaps transactions as block \\ntrades during the initial period because of their relatively illiquid \\nmarkets.\\\\371\\\\ In the alternative, EEI recommended setting the initial \\nminimum block size at no higher than $3 million, which would \\napproximately equate the proposed initial block size for the Henry Hub \\nNatural Gas futures contract.\\\\372\\\\ ICAP Energy recommended setting the \\ninitial minimum block size at 2500 mmBtu.\\\\373\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\371\\\\ CL-EEI at 8.\\n    \\\\372\\\\ According to EEI, the proposed initial minimum block size \\nof 1,000,000 mmBtu for the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract is \\napproximately equal to a minimum block size of $3 million. EEI \\nComment Letter at 8-9.\\n    \\\\373\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Parity Energy commented on the ambiguity of the term ``economically \\nrelated\\'\\' and requested clarification that natural gas swaps with \\noptionality that reference or are economically related to the Henry Hub \\nNatural Gas options would be subject to the initial minimum block size \\nproposed for that particular swap category (5,500,000 mmBtu), rather \\nthan the block size for Henry Hub Natural Gas futures (1,000,000 \\nmmBtu).\\\\374\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\374\\\\ CL-Parity at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Parity Energy opposed the proposed initial minimum block size of \\n100,000 bbl. to crude oil swaps with optionality as too low and \\nrecommended that the Commission establish a separate initial minimum \\nblock size for such swaps at 1,000,000 bbl., which would be consistent \\nwith CME\\'s minimum block size for Light Sweet Crude Oil options.\\\\375\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\375\\\\ Id. at 4-5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ICAP Energy commented that swaps that reference or are economically\\n\\n[[Page 32900]]\\n\\nrelated to the NYMEX New York Harbor RBOB Gasoline futures contract, \\nfor which the Commission has not set an initial minimum block size \\nunder proposed appendix F, should be subject to a block size that is \\nconsistent with the one set by DCMs for the related futures \\ncontract.\\\\376\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\376\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 1-2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission has considered the comments above regarding the \\nappropriate unit of measurement and initial appropriate minimum block \\nsize for the natural gas and electricity swap categories in the other \\ncommodity asset class. Based on those comments and the other commodity \\nswap categories adopted by the Commission in this final rule that are \\nbased on the converted natural gas and electricity futures \\ncontracts,\\\\377\\\\ the Commission is setting the appropriate minimum block \\nsizes for these categories in the initial period based on the block \\nsizes set by DCMs for these futures contracts. The Commission is \\nadopting this approach for several reasons. This approach is consistent \\nwith the Commission\\'s approach for swaps that reference or are \\neconomically related to one of the futures contracts previously listed \\nin appendix B to part 43 or adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(ii), which \\nutilizes the experience of DCMs in setting block sizes for these \\ncontracts. The Commission also believes this approach is more \\nconservative than the proposed $25 million initial minimum block size, \\nwhich might adversely affect market liquidity for the electricity and \\nnatural gas swaps markets. Further, this approach responds to comments \\nby setting the initial minimum block sizes based on underlying units, \\nrather than notional amount, and would be more appropriate to avoid \\nprice fluctuations and to establish consistency with post-initial \\ncalculation methodology.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\377\\\\ See supra note 176.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In response to Parity Energy and consistent with the Commission\\'s \\nadopted approach to swaps categories in the other commodity asset class \\nunder Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i)-(ii), the Commission is not establishing \\ninitial appropriate minimum block sizes based on DCM block sizes for \\nswaps that reference or are economically related to the options \\ncontracts listed in proposed appendix F.\\\\378\\\\ The Commission is \\nestablishing initial appropriate minimum block size for such swaps \\nbased on the adopted methodology for swaps with optionality, as \\ndiscussed further below.\\\\379\\\\ The notional size of swaps with \\noptionality in the initial period will be equal to the notional size of \\nthe swap component without the optional component; accordingly, the \\nappropriate minimum block size will be based on the block sizes for \\neconomically related futures contracts set by DCMs.\\\\380\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\378\\\\ See supra note 187 and accompanying text.\\n    \\\\379\\\\ See infra Section II.C.\\n    \\\\380\\\\ See infra Section II.B.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is otherwise adopting the rule generally as proposed \\nunder Sec.  43.6(e) with respect to swaps in the other commodity asset \\nclass, but also is updating initial appropriate minimum block sizes \\nproposed in appendix F, consistent with block sizes set by DCMs for the \\nrelevant related futures contract.\\\\381\\\\ In response to ICAP Energy\\'s \\nrequest, the Commission is also setting an initial minimum block size \\nfor swaps that reference or are economically related to the NYMEX New \\nYork Harbor RBOB Gasoline futures contract that is based on the DCM \\nblock size set for that contract.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\381\\\\ The Commission is also amending the initial minimum block \\nsize for swaps that reference or are economically related to the \\nGSCI Excess Return Index, Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index, Gulf Coast \\nSour Crude Oil, and Palladium futures contract. The Commission is \\nalso removing the initial minimum block size for swaps that \\nreference or are economically related to the Non-Farm Payroll, \\nInternational Skimmed Milk Powder, and Wood Pulp futures contracts, \\nas these contracts are no longer listed for trading. See supra note \\n187.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nii. Post-Initial Period Methodology\\n    In the post-initial period, the Commission provided in proposed \\nSec.  43.6(f)(3) to determine appropriate minimum block sizes for swaps \\nin the other commodity asset class by using the 67-percent notional \\namount calculation set forth in proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(1). The 67-\\npercent notional amount calculation would be applied to publicly \\nreportable swap transactions in each swap category observed during the \\nappropriate time period.\\n    Several commenters opposed the 67-percent notional amount \\ncalculation methodology for swaps in the other commodity asset class in \\nthe post-initial period.\\\\382\\\\ CME and WMBAA characterized the proposed \\nmethodology as overbroad and recommended a more tailored approach based \\non the trading profiles of each particular market.\\\\383\\\\ Barclays \\ncommented that the Commission has no data or evidence demonstrating \\nthat such a notional amount would properly balance liquidity and \\ntransparency considerations.\\\\384\\\\ ICAP Energy recommended a lower post-\\ninitial notional amount--either 33 or 50 percent--that would account \\nfor the illiquid nature of the electricity and natural gas basis swaps \\nmarket.\\\\385\\\\ Based on the non-standardized and bespoke nature of many \\nelectricity and natural gas swap transactions, EEI recommended that the \\nCommission eliminate post-initial minimum block sizes for the \\nelectricity and natural gas swap categories for the swaps added to \\nappendix B to part 43.\\\\386\\\\ EEI also recommended that the Commission \\neliminate minimum post-initial block sizes for the electricity swap \\ncategory under appendix D.\\\\387\\\\ In the alternative, EEI recommended \\nthat the Commission set the minimum block sizes for each of these \\ncategories at no greater than $3 million.\\\\388\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\382\\\\ CL-Barclays at 10; CL-CME at 2, 4; CL-WMBAA at 2-3.\\n    \\\\383\\\\ CL-CME at 4; CL-WMBAA at 2-3.\\n    \\\\384\\\\ CL-Barclays at 10.\\n    \\\\385\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 3.\\n    \\\\386\\\\ CL-EEI at 8-9.\\n    \\\\387\\\\ Id. at 9.\\n    \\\\388\\\\ EEI requested that the Commission delay the adoption of \\nminimum block sizes for the swaps in these categories for at least \\none year until it has obtained at least one year of data from an \\nSDR; in the interim, all relevant transactions would be eligible for \\nblock trade treatment. CL-EEI at 11.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(f)(1) as proposed for swap categories in the other \\ncommodity asset class for the post-initial period. The reasons stated \\nby the Commission above in support of this methodology in the post-\\ninitial period also apply to swaps in this asset class. The Commission \\nbelieves that this methodology will ensure that the vast majority of \\nswap transactions are subject to real-time reporting.\\\\389\\\\ In addition, \\napplying the same post-initial notional amount calculation to the other \\ncommodity asset class provides a consistent, bright-line rule regarding \\nhow appropriate minimum block thresholds will be calculated, thus \\nproviding clarity to market participants engaging in swap transactions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\389\\\\ See note 41 supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n6. Special Provisions for the Determination of Appropriate Minimum \\nBlock Sizes for Certain Types of Swaps\\n    The Commission recognizes the complexity of the swaps market may \\nmake it difficult to determine appropriate minimum block sizes for \\nparticular types of swaps under the methodologies discussed above. For \\nthat reason, the Commission proposed Sec.  43.6(h), which sets out a \\nseries of special rules that apply to the determination of the \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for particular types of swaps. The \\nCommission proposed special rules with respect to: (a) Swaps with \\noptionality; (b) swaps with composite reference prices \\\\390\\\\; (c)\\n\\n[[Page 32901]]\\n\\n``physical commodity swaps\\'\\' \\\\391\\\\; (d) currency conversions; and (e) \\nsuccessor currencies. Each of these special rules is discussed in the \\nsubsections below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\390\\\\ In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission proposed \\namending Sec.  43.2 to define ``swaps with composite reference \\nprices\\'\\' as swaps based on reference prices composed of more than \\none reference price that are in differing swap categories. The \\nCommission proposed to use this term in connection with the \\nestablishment of a method through which parties to a swap \\ntransaction can determine whether a component to their swap would \\nqualify the entire swap as a block trade or large notional off-\\nfacility swap. The Commission is adopting this definition as \\nproposed.\\n    \\\\391\\\\ In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission proposed to \\namend Sec.  43.2 of the Commission\\'s regulations by defining the \\nterm ``physical commodity swap\\'\\' as a swap in the other commodity \\nasset class that is based on a tangible commodity. The Commission is \\nadopting this definition as proposed.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\na. Swaps With Optionality\\n    A swap with optionality highlights special concerns in terms of \\ndetermining whether the notional size of such swap would be treated as \\na block trade or large notional off-facility swap. Proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(1) addressed these concerns by providing that the notional size \\nof swaps with optionality would equal the notional size of the swap \\ncomponent without the optional component. For example, a LIBOR 3-month \\ncall swaption with a calculated notional size of $9 billion for the \\nswap component--regardless of option component, strike price, or the \\nappropriate delta factor--would have a notional size of $9 billion for \\nthe purpose of determining whether the swap would qualify as a block \\ntrade or large notional off-facility swap.\\\\392\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\392\\\\ In essence, this approach would assume a delta factor of \\none with respect to the underlying swap for swaptions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received two comments regarding proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(1). FIA stated that the approach failed to recognize potential \\ndifferences in liquidity between the swap and an underlying \\nswaption.\\\\393\\\\ FIA also pointed out that the Further Block Proposal did \\nnot explicitly address how to handle combinations of options.\\\\394\\\\ With \\nrespect to options transactions involving swaps in the electricity, \\nnatural gas, and crude oil swap categories that are used to carry out \\ncomplex strategies, ICAP Energy recommended treating all such \\ntransactions, as well as related swap hedges, as block trades.\\\\395\\\\ \\nICAP Energy cited the complex nature of these transactions and the \\ncommon involvement of an intermediary in carrying them out as reasons \\nfor across-the-board treatment as block trades.\\\\396\\\\ ICAP Energy, \\nhowever, supported the proposed approach of adopting the block sizes \\nset by DCMs for natural gas and electricity outright options.\\\\397\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\393\\\\ CL-FIA at 3.\\n    \\\\394\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\395\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 6.\\n    \\\\396\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\397\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(h)(1) as proposed. In response to ICAP Energy, the \\nCommission believes that the proposed approach provides an easily \\ncalculable method for market participants to ascertain whether their \\nswaps with optionality features would qualify as a block trade or large \\nnotional off-facility swap. The Commission is aware that this approach \\ndoes not take into account the risk profile of a swap with optionality \\ncompared to that of a ``plain-vanilla swap,\\'\\' but believes that this \\napproach is reasonable to minimize complexity.\\nb. Swaps With Composite Reference Prices\\n    Swaps with two or more reference prices (i.e., composite reference \\nprices) raise concerns as to which reference price market participants \\nshould use to determine whether such swap qualifies as a block trade or \\nlarge notional off-facility swap.\\\\398\\\\ Proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(2) \\nprovides that the parties to a swap transaction with composite \\nreference prices (i.e., two or more reference prices) may elect to \\napply the lowest appropriate minimum block size applicable to any \\ncomponent swap category. This provision also would apply to: (1) \\nLocational or grade-basis swaps that reflect differences between two or \\nmore reference prices; and (2) swaps utilizing a reference price based \\non weighted averages of component reference prices.\\\\399\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\398\\\\ Swaps with composite reference prices are composed of \\nreference prices that relate to one another based on the difference \\nbetween two or more underlying reference prices--for example, a \\nlocational basis swap (e.g., a natural gas Rockies Basis swap) that \\nutilizes a reference price based on the difference between a price \\nof a commodity at one location (e.g., a Henry Hub index price) and a \\nprice at another location (e.g., a Rock Mountains index price).\\n    \\\\399\\\\ In other words, swaps with a composite reference price \\ncomposed of reference prices that relate to one another based on an \\nadditive relationship. This term would include swaps that are priced \\nbased on a weighted index of reference prices.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Under proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(2), market participants would need to \\ndecompose their composite reference price swap transaction in order to \\ndetermine whether their swap would qualify as a block trade or large \\nnotional off-facility swap. For example, assume that the appropriate \\nminimum block size for futures A-related swaps is $3 million, for \\nfutures B-related swaps is $800,000, for futures C-related swaps is \\n$1.2 million and for futures D-related swaps is $1 million. If a swap \\nis based on a composite reference price that itself is based on the \\nweighted average of futures price A, futures price B, futures price C, \\nand futures price D (25% equal weightings for each), and the notional \\nsize of the swap is $4 million (i.e., $1 million for each component \\nswap), then the swap would qualify as a block trade or large notional \\noff-facility swap based on the futures B-related swap appropriate \\nminimum block size.\\n    The Commission received one comment regarding proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(2). AFR recommended that transactions that are composites of \\nswaps that are economically equivalents of futures contracts should be \\ndisaggregated and separately priced for the purpose of determining \\napplicability of the block rules. AFR also recommended that the \\nCommission be vigilant of the use of composite swaps by counterparties \\nin order to ``evade the purpose of Section 727 and the Proposed \\nRules.\\'\\' \\\\400\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\400\\\\ CL-AFR at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    With respect to spread transactions, ICAP Energy recommended that \\nthe minimum block size limit be based upon the lowest limit leg of the \\ntransaction, in a manner consistent with the proposed approach to \\nsetting minimum block size limits for the mixed asset swap class.\\\\401\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\401\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Based upon the comments received, the Commission is adopting Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(2) with certain clarifications based upon general concerns \\nexpressed by commenters regarding the use of composite swaps to evade \\nminimum block sizes. The Commission is of the view that this rule \\nprovides market participants with a straightforward and uncomplicated \\nway in which to determine whether such swap would qualify as a block \\ntrade or large notional off-facility swap, but that a clarification is \\nneeded to avoid the risk of evasion raised by commenters. In response \\nto ICAP Energy\\'s comments, the Commission highlights to provide clarity \\nthat ``any component swap category\\'\\' as used above in the methodology \\napplies to swaps with a single Unique Swap Identifier (``USI\\'\\') for the \\ncombination of swaps identified with a single Unique Product Identifier \\n(``UPI\\'\\') and not to groups of different swaps each with separate USIs \\ntransacted on or near the same time.\\\\402\\\\ Further, the reference to \\n``any component swap category\\'\\' does not\\n\\n[[Page 32902]]\\n\\nlimit the application of this standard to those composite reference \\nswaps comprised of only multiple asset classes and instead should be \\nunderstood to apply more broadly to composite swaps of multiple asset \\nclasses (i.e., a mixed asset swap), intra asset classes, and intra swap \\ncategory composite reference prices.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\402\\\\ The real-time public reporting rules would apply to each \\nof the separate USIs as previously finalized in part 43. 17 CFR \\n45.5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To provide further clarity and clarification in response to AFR\\'s \\ncomment, the Commission provides the following additional example of \\ndetermining whether a composite reference price swap transaction would \\nqualify as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. For \\nexample, assume that the appropriate minimum block size for swap \\ncategory E is $50 million and for swap category F is $200 million. If a \\nsingle swap transaction with a corresponding singular reporting \\nobligation is based on a composite reference price that itself is based \\non the weighted average of (1) one component in swap category E; (2) a \\nsecond component in swap category E; and (3) a component in swap \\ncategory F (33% equal weightings for each), and the notional size of \\nthe swap is $75 million (i.e., $25 million for each component swap), \\nthen the swap would not qualify as a block trade or large notional off-\\nfacility swap based on either the swap category E or the swap category \\nF appropriate minimum block size.\\nc. Physical Commodity Swaps\\n    Block trade sizes for physical commodities are generally expressed \\nin terms of notional quantities (e.g., barrels, bushels, gallons, \\nmetric tons, troy ounces, etc.). The Commission proposed a similar \\nconvention for determining the appropriate minimum block sizes for \\nblock trades and large notional off-facility swaps. In particular, \\nproposed Sec.  43.6(h)(3) provides that notional sizes for physical \\ncommodity swaps shall be expressed in terms of notional quantities \\nusing the notional unit measure utilized in the related futures \\ncontract market or the predominant notional unit measure used to \\ndetermine notional quantities in the cash market for the relevant, \\nunderlying physical commodity. This approach ensures that appropriate \\nminimum block size thresholds for physical commodities are not subject \\nto volatility introduced by fluctuating prices. This approach also \\neliminates complications arising from converting a physical commodity \\ntransaction in one currency into another currency to determine \\nqualification for treatment as a block trade or large notional off-\\nfacility swap.\\n    The Commission received no comments regarding proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(3). The Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(h)(3) as proposed.\\nd. Currency Conversion\\n    Under proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(4), the Commission provided that when \\ndetermining whether a swap transaction denominated in a currency other \\nthan U.S. dollars qualifies as a block trade or large notional off-\\nfacility swap, swap counterparties and registered entities may use a \\ncurrency exchange rate that is widely published within the preceding \\ntwo business days from the date of execution of the swap transaction in \\norder to determine such qualification. This proposed approach would \\nenable market participants to use a currency exchange rate that they \\ndeem to be the most appropriate or easiest to obtain.\\n    The Commission received no comments regarding proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(4). The Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(h)(4) as proposed.\\ne. Successor Currencies\\n    As noted above, the Commission proposed using currency as a \\ncriterion to determine swap categories in the interest rate asset \\nclass.\\\\403\\\\ The Commission also proposed to classify the euro (EUR) as \\na super-major currency, among other currencies.\\\\404\\\\ Proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(5) provides that for currencies that succeed a super-major \\ncurrency, the appropriate currency classification for such currency \\nwould be based on the corresponding nominal gross domestic product \\n(``GDP\\'\\') classification (in U.S. dollars) as determined in the most \\nrecent World Bank World Development Indicator at the time of \\nsuccession. This proposed provision is intended to address the possible \\nremoval of one or more of the 17 EU member states that use the \\neuro.\\\\405\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\403\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(b)(1)(i) and the related \\ndiscussion in section II.B.1. of the Further Block Proposal.\\n    \\\\404\\\\ See the proposed amendment to Sec.  43.2, defining \\n``super-major currencies.\\'\\'\\n    \\\\405\\\\ The 17 European Union member states that use the euro are: \\nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, \\nIreland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, \\nSlovakia, Slovenia and Spain.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(5)(i)-(iii) further specifies the manner in \\nwhich the Commission would classify a successor currency for each \\ncountry that was once a part of the predecessor currency. Specifically, \\nthe Commission proposes to use GDP to determine how to classify a \\nsuccessor currency. For countries with a GDP greater than $2 trillion, \\nthe Commission would classify the successor currency to be a super-\\nmajor currency.\\\\406\\\\ For countries with a GDP greater than $500 billion \\nbut less than $2 trillion, the Commission would classify the successor \\ncurrency as a major currency.\\\\407\\\\ For nations with a GDP less than \\n$500 billion, the Commission would classify the successor currency as a \\nnon-major currency.\\\\408\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\406\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(6)(i).\\n    \\\\407\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(6)(ii).\\n    \\\\408\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(6)(iii).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received no comments regarding proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(5). The Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(h)(5) as proposed.\\n\\nC. Procedural Provisions\\n\\n1. Sec. 43.6(a) Commission Determination\\n    The Commission proposed that it determine the appropriate minimum \\nblock size for any swap listed on a SEF or DCM, and for large notional \\noff-facility swaps. Proposed Sec.  43.6(a) specifically provides that \\nthe Commission would establish the appropriate minimum block sizes for \\npublicly reportable swap transactions based on the swap categories set \\nforth in proposed Sec.  43.6(b) in accordance with the provisions set \\nforth in proposed Sec. Sec.  43.6(c), (d), (e), (f) and (h), as \\napplicable.\\n    The Commission received eight comments regarding determination of \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for swaps listed on a SEF or DCM. Four \\ncommenters favored allowing SEFs and DCMs to set appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes for the swaps they list. CME stated that the Commission \\nwould be better served by retaining the ability to set block levels in \\nthe private, bilateral swaps market and deferring to the expertise of \\nSEFs and DCMs to set the levels in their markets.\\\\409\\\\ ICAP suggested \\nthat the Commission utilize the same approach as for the futures \\nmarkets, where futures exchanges set their own block sizes, and allow \\nSEFs to set block sizes since they have an incentive to provide as much \\ninformation about trading interest as possible without hurting \\nliquidity.\\\\410\\\\ Morgan Stanley suggested that the Commission could \\nallow DCMs and SEFs to set appropriate block sizes, subject to \\nCommission approval, as DCMs and SEFs would benefit from setting block \\nsizes in a way that maximizes liquidity.\\\\411\\\\ WMBAA stated that the \\nCommission should authorize SEFs to analyze ongoing swaps market\\n\\n[[Page 32903]]\\n\\ntrading activity and trade data to determine uniform thresholds that \\ndistinguish transactions that move markets from those that do not, and \\nwork to ensure that block trade regimes for swaps executed on SEFs and \\nDCMs are as consistent as possible to avoid arbitrage.\\\\412\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\409\\\\ CL-CME at 3.\\n    \\\\410\\\\ CL-ICAP at 5-6.\\n    \\\\411\\\\ CL-Morgan Stanley at 3.\\n    \\\\412\\\\ CL-WMBAA at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Four commenters supported the Commission\\'s proposal that the \\nCommission set minimum block levels. Three of those commenters \\nrecommended that SEFs and DCMs should not be able to set minimum block \\nthresholds above the level mandated by the Commission. Javelin asserted \\nthat the CFTC should set block trade rules and not SEFs, so as to avoid \\na race to the bottom that would harm transparency and threaten \\ncompetition.\\\\413\\\\ SIFMA stated that the Commission should set minimum \\nblock trade size thresholds and argued that allowing SEFs and DCMs to \\nset a block size threshold above the minimum level mandated by the \\nCommission without guidance is inconsistent with the Commission\\'s \\nstatutory duty ``to specify the criteria for determining what \\nconstitutes a large notional swap transaction (block trade) for \\nparticular markets and contracts.\\'\\' \\\\414\\\\ AII also stated that SEFs or \\nDCMs should not have the ability to set block sizes for swaps at higher \\nlevels than the appropriate minimum block sizes determined by the \\nCommission, as SEFs in particular have interests that may not be \\naligned with buy-side firms and may not be incentivized to ensure that \\nmarket disruption is minimal.\\\\415\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\413\\\\ CL-Javelin at 6.\\n    \\\\414\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 11-12.\\n    \\\\415\\\\ CL-AII at 10.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In addition, ICAP Energy stated that SEF block limits for futures \\nequivalent swap contracts should adjust automatically to meet DCM \\ncontract limits adjustments between annual revisions of SEF block \\nlimits, so that the Commission does not set SEF block levels at levels \\nhigher than the block levels set by DCMs.\\n    Based upon the comments received, the Commission is adopting Sec.  \\n43.6(a) as proposed. The Commission agrees with the commenters who \\nrecommended that appropriate minimum block thresholds for swaps be set \\nby the Commission, rather than SEFs or DCMs. The Commission concurs \\nwith SIFMA that it has a statutory duty ``to specify the criteria for \\ndetermining what constitutes a large notional swap transaction (block \\ntrade) for particular markets and contracts.\\'\\' \\\\416\\\\ The Commission \\nalso agrees with Javelin that allowing SEFs and DCMs to set appropriate \\nminimum block thresholds could lead to a race to the bottom that would \\nharm transparency and reduce competition. In the Commission\\'s view, the \\nCommission\\'s approach is also the least burdensome from a cost-benefit \\nperspective because it significantly reduces the direct costs imposed \\non registered entities. Moreover, while Sec.  43.6(a) states that the \\nCommission will determine minimum block sizes, as recommended by some \\nof the commenters, the Commission notes that SEFs and DCMs nonetheless \\nwill have the discretion to set block sizes for swaps at levels that \\nare higher than the appropriate minimum block sizes determined by the \\nCommission.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\416\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 11-12; 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(13)(E)(ii).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. 43.6(f)(4) and (5) Publication and Effective Date of Post-Initial \\nAppropriate Minimum Block Sizes\\n    Proposed Sec.  43.6(f)(3) provided that the Commission would \\npublish the post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes on its Web \\nsite. Proposed Sec.  43.6(f)(4) provided that these sizes would become \\neffective on the first day of the second month following the date of \\npublication. Per proposed Sec.  43.6(f)(1), the Commission would \\npublish updated post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes in the \\nsame manner no less than once each calendar year.\\n    Several commenters recommended that post-initial appropriate \\nminimum block sizes should be updated more frequently than on an annual \\nbasis.\\\\417\\\\ ICI, AII and SIFMA recommended a quarterly or at least a \\nsemi-annual calculation in order to account for changes in liquidity in \\nthe market.\\\\418\\\\ Spring Trading and Vanguard recommended a quarterly \\ncalculation that would allow block levels to be more responsive to the \\nmarket.\\\\419\\\\ Kinetix, however, recommended that calculations should be \\ncarried out on a monthly basis.\\\\420\\\\ MFA suggested that the Commission \\nmaintain the optional ability to update the minimum block size on a \\nmore frequent basis as well as shorten the look-back window for the \\nrelevant data set.\\\\421\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\417\\\\ CL-GFMA at 3.\\n    \\\\418\\\\ CL-ICI at 7; CL-AII at 11; CL-SIFMA at 6-7.\\n    \\\\419\\\\ CL-TeraExchange at 2; CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n    \\\\420\\\\ CL-Kinetix at 2.\\n    \\\\421\\\\ CL-MFA at 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Some commenters asserted that the Commission should have the \\nauthority to update appropriate minimum block sizes outside of the \\nproposed 1-year set look-back period. GFMA believed that the Commission \\nshould have this authority, without reference to a data set, to respond \\nto a market that quickly becomes illiquid.\\\\422\\\\ MFA also supported \\nproviding this authority, but believed that the Commission should \\nexercise this authority based on SDR data received for individual or \\nmultiple swap categories.\\\\423\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\422\\\\ CL-GFMA at 4.\\n    \\\\423\\\\ CL-MFA at 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Based on its argument that block levels set by SEFs should not be \\nhigher than those set by DCMs, ICAP Energy recommended allowing for \\nautomatic adjustment to occur during the course of the year.\\\\424\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\424\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is adopting the rule as proposed, with the one \\nmodification that proposed Sec.  43.6(f)(3) and (4) will be adopted as \\nSec.  43.6(f)(4) and (5). The rule as adopted only requires that the \\nCommission to update post-initial minimum block sizes at least once a \\nyear and therefore does not preclude the Commission from doing so on a \\nmore frequent basis. The Commission anticipates that it will examine \\nand re-calculate such block sizes at regular intervals, but also \\nacknowledges that the liquidity of a swap market may change \\nsignificantly outside of such intervals. Therefore, the Commission \\nreserves the authority to update minimum block sizes when warranted and \\nas necessary to respond to such circumstances. In response to GFMA and \\nMFA, the Commission agrees with MFA and emphasizes that in all \\ncircumstances, minimum block sizes will be updated based on the \\nrelevant market data received.\\n    In response to ICAP Energy\\'s recommendation, the Commission notes \\nthat adopting such a requirement would potentially create minimum block \\nsize re-alignment issues for SEFs, particularly during the initial \\nperiod for swaps in the other commodity class. Under this requirement, \\nSEFs would be de facto subject to a DCM\\'s own business decisions, i.e., \\nblock trade size calculations that are based on trading that does not \\noccur on their own facility or platform. Further, the Commission has \\nnoted that SEFs and DCMs may set minimum block sizes that are higher \\nthan those prescribed by the Commission; this recommended requirement \\nwould otherwise preclude such an ability in certain cases. Accordingly, \\nthe Commission declines to adopt this requirement.\\n3. Sec. 43.6(g) Notification of Election\\n    Proposed Sec.  43.6(g) set forth the election process through which \\na qualifying swap transaction would be treated as a block trade or \\nlarge notional\\n\\n[[Page 32904]]\\n\\noff-facility swap, as applicable. Proposed Sec.  43.6(g)(1) would \\nestablish a two-step notification process relating to block trades. \\nProposed Sec.  43.6(g)(2) would establish the notification process \\nrelating to large notional off-facility swaps.\\n    Proposed Sec.  43.6(g)(1)(i) contained the first step in the two-\\nstep notification process relating to block trades. In particular, the \\nparties to a publicly reportable swap transaction that has a notional \\namount at or above the appropriate minimum block size would be required \\nto notify the SEF or DCM (pursuant to the rules of such SEF or DCM) of \\ntheir election to have their qualifying publicly reportable swap \\ntransaction treated as a block trade.\\\\425\\\\ With respect to the second \\nstep, proposed Sec.  43.6(g)(1)(ii) provided that the SEF or DCM that \\nreceives an election notification would be required to notify the \\nrelevant SDR of such block trade election when transmitting swap \\ntransaction and pricing data to the SDR for public dissemination.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\425\\\\ In order to qualify as a block trade, a swap must (1) be \\nlisted on a registered SEF or DCM; (2) occur away from the \\nregistered SEF\\'s or DCM\\'s trading system or platform and is executed \\npursuant to its rules and procedures; and (3) have a notional or \\nprincipal amount at or above the appropriate minimum block size \\napplicable to such swap. See Sec.  43.2. By definition, a block \\ntrade must occur away from the SEF or DCM\\'s trading system or \\nplatform and thus cannot be transacted on the SEF or DCM\\'s trading \\nsystem or platform. Moreover, the swap must be at or above the \\nappropriate minimum block size at the time that it becomes a \\npublicly reportable swap transaction. Any swap that is executed on a \\nSEF or DCM\\'s trading system or platform, regardless of whether it is \\nfor a size at or above the appropriate minimum block size for such \\nswap, is not a block trade under this definition, and, thus, is \\nrequired to be publicly disseminated in real-time pursuant to Sec.  \\n43.4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Similar to the first step set forth in proposed Sec.  43.6(g)(1), \\nproposed Sec.  43.6(g)(2) would provide, in part, that a reporting \\nparty who executes an off-facility swap with a notional amount at or \\nabove the applicable appropriate minimum block size would be required \\nto notify the relevant SDR of its election to treat such swap as a \\nlarge notional off-facility swap. This section provided further that \\nthe reporting party would be required to notify the relevant SDR in \\nconnection with the reporting party\\'s transmission of swap transaction \\nand pricing data to the SDR pursuant to Sec.  43.3 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations.\\n    The Commission received no comments regarding proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(g). The Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(g) as proposed.\\n4. Sec. 43.7 Delegation of Authority\\n    Under proposed Sec.  43.7(a), the Commission would delegate the \\nauthority to undertake certain Commission actions to the Director of \\nthe Division of Market Oversight (``Director\\'\\') and to other employees \\nas designated by the Director from time to time. In particular, this \\nproposed delegation would grant to the Director the authority to \\ndetermine: (1) New swap categories as described in proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(b); (2) post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes as described \\nin proposed Sec.  43.6(f); and (3) post-initial cap sizes as described \\nin the proposed amendments to Sec.  43.4(h)(2) of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations.\\\\426\\\\ The purpose of the proposed delegation provision \\nwould be to facilitate the Commission\\'s ability to respond \\nexpeditiously to ever-changing swap market and technological \\nconditions. The Commission is of the view that this delegation would \\nhelp ensure timely and accurate real-time public reporting of swap \\ntransaction and pricing data and further ensure anonymity in connection \\nwith the public reporting of such data. Proposed Sec.  43.7(b) provided \\nthat the Director may submit to the Commission for its consideration \\nany matter that has been delegated pursuant to this authority. Proposed \\nSec.  43.7(c) provided that the delegation to the Director would not \\nprevent the Commission, at its election, from exercising the delegated \\nauthority.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\426\\\\ See the discussion of post-initial cap sizes in section \\nIII.B. infra. As noted above, the Commission proposed an amendment \\nto Sec.  43.2 to define the term ``cap size\\'\\' as the maximum limit \\nof the principal, notional amount of a swap that is publicly \\ndisseminated. This term applies to the cap sizes determined in \\naccordance with the proposed amendments to Sec.  43.4(h) of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received no comments regarding proposed Sec.  \\n43.7(a) and therefore is adopting Sec.  43.7(a) as proposed.\\n5. Section 43.6(h)(6) Aggregation\\n    Proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(6) would prohibit the aggregation of orders \\nfor different trading accounts in order to satisfy the minimum block \\nsize or cap size requirements, except that aggregation would be \\npermissible if done on a DCM or SEF by a person who: (i)(A) Is a CTA \\nregistered pursuant to Section 4n of the CEA or exempt from such \\nregistration under the Act, or a principal thereof, and who has \\ndiscretionary trading authority or directs client accounts, (B) is an \\ninvestment adviser who has discretionary trading authority or directs \\nclient accounts and satisfies the criteria of Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of \\nthis chapter, or (C) is a foreign person who performs a similar role or \\nfunction as the persons described in (A) or (B) and is subject as such \\nto foreign regulation, and (ii) has more than $25 million in total \\nassets under management. In the Commission\\'s view, such a prohibition \\nwould be integral to ensuring the integrity of block trade principles \\nand preserving the basis for the anonymity associated with establishing \\ncap sizes.\\n    The Commission received a number of comments on the proposed \\naggregation rule, particularly as to the enumerated persons who would \\notherwise be allowed to aggregate orders from different trading \\naccounts. Barnard supported the rule, noting that it would help ensure \\nthat non-block transactions comply with the exchange trading \\nrequirements and real-time reporting obligations, thereby increasing \\ntransparency and price discovery, promoting market integrity, improving \\nefficiency and competitiveness in the swap markets, and ultimately \\nproviding timely information to enable market participants to improve \\ntheir risk management practices.\\\\427\\\\ Barnard suggested that the \\nCommission add an additional requirement--that the ``block trade is \\nsuitable for customers of such persons\\'\\'--on the basis that such a \\nrequirement would improve consistency in the rules applicable to swap \\nand futures markets.\\\\428\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\427\\\\ CL-Barnard at 2.\\n    \\\\428\\\\ CL-Barnard at 2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ABC and CIEBA stated that qualified investment advisers who are not \\nCTAs should be able to aggregate block trade orders for different \\ntrading accounts.\\\\429\\\\ Tradeweb commented that CTAs who trade on a SEF \\nshould also be permitted to aggregate trades on behalf of their \\ncustomers for purposes of block trades.\\\\430\\\\ JP Morgan commented that \\nthis rule appears to reflect a concern that private negotiation affords \\nless protection to unsophisticated investors than trading through the \\ncentral markets, and that since all entities that transact in the OTC \\nmarket already must be ECPs, the analogous concern about customer \\nprotection in the swaps market is already addressed.\\\\431\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\429\\\\ CL-ABC/CIEBA at 3.\\n    \\\\430\\\\ CL-Tradeweb at 5.

ICI also disagreed that an \\ninvestment adviser seeking to aggregate orders must satisfy the \\ncriteria of Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of the Commission\\'s regulations.\\\\434\\\\ \\nICI suggested that the Commission only require an investment adviser to \\nbe registered under Sec.  203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or \\npursuant to the laws of any state without specifying a minimum \\nregistration length or location for deposit of client assets.\\\\435\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\432\\\\ CL-ICI at 3.\\n    \\\\433\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\434\\\\ Id. at 4.

In response to the \\ncomment by ABC and CIEBA, the Commission notes that qualified \\ninvestment advisers, who are not CTAs, are able to aggregate block \\ntrade orders from different trading accounts. Under Sec.  \\n43.6(h)(6)(i)(B) and (ii), investment advisers that satisfy the \\ncriteria under Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) and have more than $25 million in \\ntotal assets under management are able to aggregate orders from \\ndifferent accounts. The Commission also agrees that CTAs who trade on a \\nSEF should be permitted to aggregate customer trades, which would be \\nallowed under the rule as adopted, subject to the enumerated \\nconditions.\\n    With respect to JP Morgan\\'s comment, the Commission notes that \\ncustomers trading swaps on DCMs do not have to be ECPs. As discussed \\nfurther below, adopted Sec.  43.6(i)(1) allows non-ECP customers to be \\nparties to block trades through a qualifying CTA, investment adviser, \\nor similar foreign person.\\\\440\\\\ It is possible, therefore, that those \\nnon-ECP DCM customers may not be aware if they received the best terms \\nfor their individual swap transactions that are aggregated with other \\ntransactions.

Section 43.6(i) Eligible Block Trade Participants\\n    Proposed Sec.  43.6(i)(1) provided that parties to a block trade \\nmust be ECPs, as defined under Section 1a(18) of the CEA and the \\nCommission\\'s regulations. The proposed rule includes an exception to \\nthe ECP requirement by providing that a DCM may allow (i) A CTA \\nregistered pursuant to Section 4n of the CEA, or exempt from \\nregistration under the CEA, or a principal thereof, who has \\ndiscretionary trading authority or directs client accounts, (ii) an \\ninvestment adviser who has discretionary trading authority or directs \\nclient accounts and satisfies the criteria the criteria of 4.7(a)(2)(v0 \\nof the Commission\\'s regulations, or (iii) a foreign person who performs \\na similar role or function to the persons described in (i) or (ii) and \\nis subject as such to foreign regulation, to transact block trades for \\ncustomers who are not ECPs, if such CTA, investment adviser or foreign \\nperson has more than $25 million in total assets under management. \\nProposed Sec.  43.6(i)(2) further provided that a person transacting a \\nblock trade on behalf of a customer must receive prior written \\ninstruction or consent from the customer to do so. Such instruction or \\nconsent may be provided in a power of attorney or similar document, by \\nwhich the customer provides the person with discretionary trading \\nauthority or the authority to direct the trading in the customer\\'s \\naccount.\\n    As discussed above, similar comments regarding the exceptions to \\nthe prohibitions against aggregation for certain persons were submitted \\nwith respect to the exception to certain persons transacting blocks on \\na DCM on behalf of non-ECPs. For example, ICI opposed the minimum \\nassets under management requirement in proposed Sec. Sec.  43.6(i)(1) \\nand similarly argued that the Commission did not articulate a rationale \\nor policy reason for this requirement.\\\\455\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\455\\\\ CL-ICI at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Specific comments were also received on proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(i)(2).\\\\456\\\\ ICI requested a clarification that only a person \\ntransacting a block trade on behalf of a customer who is not an ECP \\nmust receive prior written instruction or consent.\\\\457\\\\ ICI argued that \\nwritten instruction or consent from an ECP is not necessary because \\nthese customers can engage in block trades and that investment advisers \\nwith discretionary trading authority registered with the SEC already \\nhave the ability to aggregate orders on behalf of clients without \\nobtaining separate consent.\\\\458\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\456\\\\ CL-ICI at 5; CL-SIFMA at 1-2.\\n    \\\\457\\\\ CL-ICI at 5.\\n    \\\\458\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    SIFMA commented that proposed Sec.  43.6(i)(2) may require asset \\nmanagers to obtain consent from each client for whom they will engage \\nin block trades.\\\\459\\\\ SIFMA contended that this requirement would be \\ncostly and unnecessary, and that notice to the customers \\\\460\\\\ or a \\ngeneral grant of investment discretion in the investment management \\nagreement, power of attorney, or similar document should be \\nsufficient.\\\\461\\\\ SIFMA further commented that proposed Sec.  43.6(i)(2) \\nis unlike rules governing DCMs in the futures context.\\\\462\\\\ SIFMA also \\nargued that DCM rules requiring consent for block trades only require \\nthe direct members of the DCM to obtain consent from the members\\' \\ndirect customers, not from the customers\\' customers. Additionally, \\nSIFMA contended that a client consent requirement does not apply to \\nadvisers with respect to futures trades and should not apply to \\nadvisers with respect to swaps trades.\\\\463\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\459\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 1.\\n    \\\\460\\\\ Id. at 2.\\n    \\\\461\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\462\\\\ Id. at 1 n.4.\\n    \\\\463\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.6(i) as proposed. The Commission declines to adopt \\nICI\\'s clarification and notes that Sec.  43.6(i)(2) is intended to \\nensure that all customers of CTAs, investment advisers, and similar \\nforeign persons, whether the customers are ECPs or not, are fully \\ninformed of the use of block trades on their behalf.\\n    The Commission also disagrees with SIFMA\\'s contention regarding the \\nburdens of obtaining consent. This burden consent will be minimal \\nbecause Sec.  43.6(i)(2) states that the instruction or consent may be \\nprovided through a power of attorney or similar document that provides \\ndiscretionary trading authority or the authority to direct trading in \\nthe account. The consent may therefore be included in existing and \\nfuture customer agreements. The Commission further disagrees that a \\ngeneral grant of investment discretion or notice to the customer should \\nsatisfy Sec.  43.6(i)(2). A customer\\'s written instruction or consent \\nis necessary because a customer potentially may not receive the best \\nterms for an individual swap transaction that is part of an \\naggregation. The written instruction or consent makes the customer \\naware that block trades may be used on its behalf, allowing the \\ncustomer to decide whether to allow these transactions.\\n    The Commission notes that a similar consent requirement was \\nincluded in the Commission\\'s proposed DCM rule.\\\\464\\\\ The Commission \\nbelieves that the customer protection functions of the consent \\nrequirement apply, regardless of the degree of separation between the \\ncustomer and the DCM or SEF. As discussed above, the consent \\nrequirement ensures that customers are informed of the use of block \\ntrades for their accounts. If a CTA, an investment adviser, or a \\nsimilar foreign person plans to aggregate customer orders for block \\ntrades, then the customers must have the opportunity to evaluate \\nwhether the customer agrees to the use of aggregation, as evidenced by \\nthe written instruction or consent, regardless of whether the CTA, \\ninvestment adviser, or similar foreign person is a direct member of a \\nDCM or SEF.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\464\\\\ Core Principles and Other Requirements for Designated \\nContract Markets. 75 FR 80572, Dec. 22, 2010.

As noted in the final rule, given the number of \\ncomments received under Core Principle 9, the Commission believed \\nthat additional time was appropriate before finalizing the proposed \\nrules for Core Principle 9; it expects to consider the proposed \\nrules at a future date. 77 FR 36643, June 19, 2012.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIII. Anonymity Protections for the Public Dissemination of Swap \\nTransaction and Pricing Data\\n\\nA. Policy Goals\\n\\n    Section 2(a)(13)(E)(i) of the CEA directs the Commission to protect \\nthe identities of counterparties to swaps subject to the mandatory \\nclearing requirement, swaps excepted from the\\n\\n[[Page 32907]]\\n\\nmandatory clearing requirement, and voluntarily cleared swaps. \\nSimilarly, section 2(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the CEA requires that the \\nCommission prescribe rules that maintain the anonymity of business \\ntransactions and market positions of the counterparties to an uncleared \\nswap.\\\\465\\\\ In proposed amendments to Sec.  43.4(h) and 43.4(d)(4), as \\ndescribed further below, the Commission proposed measures to protect \\nthe identities of counterparties and to maintain the anonymity of their \\nbusiness transactions and market positions in connection with the \\npublic dissemination of publicly reportable swap transactions. The \\nCommission proposed to follow the practices used by most federal \\nagencies when releasing to the public company-specific information--by \\nremoving obvious identifiers, limiting geographic detail (e.g., \\ndisclosing general, non-specific geographical information about the \\ndelivery and pricing points) and masking high-risk variables by \\ntruncating extreme values for certain variables (e.g., capping notional \\nvalues).\\\\466\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\465\\\\ This provision does not cover swaps that are ``determined \\nto be required to be cleared but are not cleared.\\'\\' See 7 U.S.C. \\n2(a)(13)(C)(iv).\\n    \\\\466\\\\ The Commission is following the necessary procedures for \\nreleasing microdata files as outlined by the Federal Committee on \\nStatistical Methodology: (i) Removal of all direct personal and \\ninstitutional identifiers, (ii) limiting geographic detail, and \\n(iii) top-coding high-risk variables which are continuous. See \\nFederal Committee on Statistical Methodology, Report on Statistical \\nDisclosure Limitation Methodology 94 (Statistical Policy Working \\nPaper 22, 2d ed. 2005), <a href=\"http://www.fcsm.gov/working-papers/totalreport.pdf\">http://www.fcsm.gov/working-papers/totalreport.pdf</a>. The report was originally prepared by the \\nSubcommittee on Disclosure Limitation Methodology in 1994 and was \\nrevised by the Confidentiality and Data Access Committee in 2005.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nB. Establishing Notional Cap Sizes for Swap Transaction and Pricing \\nData to Be Publicly Disseminated in Real-Time\\n\\n1. Policy Goals for Establishing Notional Cap Sizes\\n    In addition to establishing appropriate minimum block sizes, the \\nCommission also proposed to amend Sec.  43.4(h) to establish cap sizes \\nfor notional and principal amounts that would mask the total size of a \\nswap transaction if it equals or exceeds the appropriate minimum block \\nsize for a given swap category. For example, if the block size for a \\ncategory of interest rate swaps was $1 billion, the cap size was $1.5 \\nbillion, and the actual transaction had a notional value of $2 billion, \\nthen this swap transaction would be publicly reported with a delay and \\nwith a notional value of $1.5+ billion.\\n    The proposed cap size provisions are consistent with the two \\nrelevant statutory requirements in section 2(a)(13) of the CEA. First, \\nthe cap size provisions would help protect the anonymity of \\ncounterparties\\' market positions and business transactions as required \\nin section 2(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the CEA.\\\\467\\\\ Second, the masking of \\nextraordinarily large positions also takes into consideration the \\nrequirement under section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv) that the Commission take into \\naccount the impact that real-time public reporting could have in \\nreducing market liquidity.\\\\468\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\467\\\\ See 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(13)(C)(iii).\\n    \\\\468\\\\ See 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(13)(E)(iv).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Proposed Amendments Related to Cap Sizes--Sec.  43.2 Definitions and \\nSec.  43.4 Swap Transaction and Pricing Data To Be Publicly \\nDisseminated in Real-Time\\n    The Commission proposed an amendment to Sec.  43.2 to define the \\nterm ``cap size\\'\\' as the maximum limit of the principal, notional \\namount of a swap that is publicly disseminated. This term applies to \\nthe cap sizes determined in accordance with the proposed amendments to \\nSec.  43.4(h) of the Commission\\'s regulations.\\n    Section 43.4(h) of the Commission\\'s regulations currently \\nestablishes interim cap sizes for rounded notional or principal amounts \\nfor all publicly reportable swap transactions. In the Real-Time \\nReporting Final Rule, the Commission finalized Sec.  43.4(h) to provide \\nthat the notional or principal amounts shall be capped in a manner that \\nadjusts in accordance with the appropriate minimum block size that \\ncorresponds to a publicly reportable swap transaction.\\\\469\\\\ Section \\n43.4(h) further provides that if no appropriate minimum block size \\nexists, then the cap size on the notional or principal amount shall \\ncorrespond to the interim cap sizes that the Commission has established \\nfor the five asset classes.\\\\470\\\\ In Sec.  43.4(h) and as described in \\nthe Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission notes that SDRs will \\napply interim cap sizes until such time as appropriate minimum block \\nsizes are established.\\\\471\\\\ The Commission continues to believe that \\nthe interim cap sizes for each swap category should correspond with the \\napplicable appropriate minimum block size, to the extent that an \\nappropriate minimum block size exists.\\\\472\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\469\\\\ See 77 FR 1247.\\n    \\\\470\\\\ Sections 43.4(h)(1)-(5) established the following interim \\ncap sizes for the corresponding asset classes: (1) Interest rate \\nswaps at $250 million for tenors greater than zero up to and \\nincluding two years, $100 million for tenors greater than two years \\nup to and including 10 years, and $75 million for tenors greater \\nthan 10 years; (2) credit swaps at $100 million; (3) equity swaps at \\n$250 million; (4) foreign exchange swaps at $250 million; and (5) \\nother commodity swaps at $25 million.\\n    \\\\471\\\\ See 77 FR 1215.\\n    \\\\472\\\\ Leading industry trade associations agree that cap sizes \\nare an appropriate mechanism to ensure that price discovery remains \\nintact for block trades, while also protecting post-block trade risk \\nmanagement needs from being anticipated by other market \\nparticipants. See ISDA and SIFMA, Block Trade Reporting for Over-\\nthe-Counter Derivatives Market, Jan. 18, 2011.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission proposed to amend Sec.  43.4(h) both to establish \\ninitial cap sizes for each swap category within the five asset classes \\nand also to delineate a process for the post-initial period through \\nwhich the Commission would establish post-initial cap sizes for each \\nswap category.\\\\473\\\\ The Commission also proposed changing the term \\n``interim\\'\\' as it is used in Sec.  43.4(h) in the Real-Time Reporting \\nRule to ``initial\\'\\' in order to correspond with the description of the \\ninitial period in proposed Sec.  43.6(e).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\473\\\\ The Commission does not intend the provisions in this \\nfinal rule to prevent a SEF or DCM from sharing the exact notional \\namounts of a swaps transaction on or pursuant to the rules of its \\nplatform with market participants on such platform irrespective of \\nthe cap sizes set by the Commission. To share the exact notional \\namounts of swaps, the SEF or DCM must comply with Sec.  \\n43.3(b)(3)(i) of the Commission\\'s regulations. See 77 FR 1245.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\na. Initial Cap Sizes\\n    In the initial period,\\\\474\\\\ proposed Sec.  43.4(h)(1) would set the \\ncap size for each swap category as the greater of the interim cap sizes \\nin all five asset classes set forth in the Real-Time Reporting Final \\nRule (Sec.  43.4(h)(1)-(5)) or the appropriate minimum block size for \\nthe respective swap category.\\\\475\\\\ If such appropriate minimum block \\nsize does not exist, then the cap sizes shall be set at the interim cap \\nsizes set forth in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule (Sec.  \\n43.4(h)(1)-(5)).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\474\\\\ The initial period is the period prior to the effective \\ndate of a Commission determination to establish applicable post-\\ninitial cap sizes. See proposed Sec.  43.4(h)(1).\\n    \\\\475\\\\ See 77 FR 1249.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For the initial period, AII and ISDA/SIFMA argued that the cap size \\nshould be the lower of block size and the interim cap size in Sec.  \\n43.4(h)(1).\\\\476\\\\ EEI stated that the cap size of $25 million for both \\nthe electricity swap contracts proposed to be added to appendix B and \\nthe electricity swaps in the other commodity swap categories in \\nappendix D, which would be based on the interim cap sizes established \\nby the Commission in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, is too high. \\nEEI instead recommended both a fixed cap size and a minimum block size \\nof $3 million.\\\\477\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\476\\\\ CL-AII at 12; CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 15.\\n    \\\\477\\\\ CL-EEI at 11-12.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting\\n\\n[[Page 32908]]\\n\\nSec.  43.4(h)(1) as proposed. EEI recommends a lower cap size for \\nspecific swap categories--particularly electricity swaps--but it does \\nnot recommend any change to the proposed interplay between cap size and \\nappropriate minimum block size during the interim period. The cap size \\nfor the interim period was established by the Real-Time Reporting Final \\nRule, and the Commission considered the appropriate level for these cap \\nsizes at that time. The Commission did not propose altering the interim \\ncap size in the Further Block Proposal, and thus did not receive \\ncomments regarding altering the interim cap size beyond that of EEI. \\nThe Commission does not believe that altering the interim cap size \\nwould be appropriate under such circumstances.\\n    AII and ISDA/SIFMA recommended that the cap size be set as the \\nlower of the appropriate minimum block size and the interim cap sizes \\nset forth in the Real-Time Reporting Rule. The Commission, however, \\ndisagrees with this view of the relationship between block thresholds \\nand cap sizes. All of the information regarding a block trade is \\nreported to the market at the end of the block time delay. Cap sizes, \\non the other hand, are never expressed to the market. Because this \\ninformation is not reported to the market in real-time, nor reported to \\nthe market at all, the Commission believes that cap sizes should be set \\nat a higher level than block sizes, in order to minimize the amount of \\ninformation that is never publicly disseminated. Accordingly, the \\nCommission is adopting Sec.  43.4(h)(1) as proposed.\\nb. Post-Initial Cap Sizes and the 75-Percent Notional Amount \\nCalculation\\n    Pursuant to proposed Sec.  43.4(h)(2)(ii), the Commission would use \\na 75 percent notional amount calculation, as proposed in Sec.  \\n43.6(c)(2), to determine the appropriate post-initial cap sizes for all \\nswap categories for the purpose of reporting block trades or large \\nnotional off-facility swaps of significant size.\\\\478\\\\ This calculation \\nmethodology would be different from the 67 percent notional amount \\ncalculation methodology that the Commission proposed in Sec.  \\n43.6(c)(1), which would be used to determine appropriate minimum block \\nsizes.\\\\479\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\478\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(2).\\n    \\\\479\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(2).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For the 75 percent notional amount calculation, the Commission \\nwould determine the appropriate cap size through the following process, \\npursuant to proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(2): (step 1) select all of the \\npublicly reportable swap transactions within a specific swap category \\nusing a rolling three-year window of data beginning with a minimum of \\none year\\'s worth of data and adding one year of data for each \\ncalculation until a total of three years of data is accumulated; (step \\n2) convert to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data set; \\n(step 3) determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the \\ntrimmed data set; (step 4) multiply the sum of the notional amount by \\n75 percent; (step 5) rank order the observations by notional amount \\nfrom least to greatest; (step 6) calculate the cumulative sum of the \\nobservations until the cumulative sum is equal to or greater than the \\n75 percent notional amount calculated in step 4; (step 7) select the \\nnotional amount associated with that observation; (step 8) round the \\nnotional amount of that observation to two significant digits, or if \\nthe notional amount associated with that observation is already \\nsignificant to two digits, increase that notional amount to the next \\nhighest rounding point of two significant digits; and (step 9) set the \\nappropriate minimum block size at the amount calculated in step 8.\\n    Consistent with the Commission\\'s proposed process to determine the \\nappropriate post-initial minimum block sizes, proposed Sec.  43.4(h)(3) \\nprovided that the Commission would publish post-initial cap sizes on \\nits Web site. Proposed Sec.  43.4(h)(4) provided that unless otherwise \\nindicated on the Commission\\'s Web site, the post-initial cap sizes \\nwould become effective on the first day of the second month following \\nthe date of publication.\\n    The Commission received 10 comments regarding the 75 percent \\nnotional amount calculation for determining post-initial cap sizes. One \\ncommenter, Javelin, supported the 75 percent notional amount \\ncalculation and stated that it was consistent with the minimum block \\nsize threshold established by the Commission.\\\\480\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\480\\\\ CL-Javelin at 2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Seven commenters, however, recommended that the Commission set \\npost-initial cap sizes matching the post-initial minimum block size \\nthresholds established by the Commission. AII recommended setting the \\npost-initial cap size for each swap category at the same level as the \\npost-initial block size threshold and states that the 75 percent \\nnotional amount calculation is far too high.\\\\481\\\\ GFMA similarly stated \\nthat the same rationale should apply to cap and block sizes, as both \\nhave potential negative impacts on liquidity.\\\\482\\\\ ICI stated that the \\n75 percent notional amount would be too high for determining cap size \\nbecause the lack of depth and liquidity in the swaps market could cause \\npublic reporting of block sizes to reveal identities, business \\ntransactions, and market positions of participants, and recommended a \\n67 percent notional amount calculation for determining cap size in the \\npost-initial period.\\\\483\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA also stated that the added \\ntransparency from reporting transaction sizes between 67 percent and 75 \\npercent would not outweigh the harm to liquidity from additional \\ndisclosure, and urges the Commission to ensure that the post-initial \\ncap size is always equal to the relevant block size.\\\\484\\\\ MFA commented \\nthat it is unnecessary for the Commission to establish cap sizes that \\ndiffer from minimum block sizes as there is not a meaningful \\ntransparency benefit that would outweigh the resource burdens on the \\nCommission, SDRs, SEFs, and other market participants.\\\\485\\\\ SIFMA \\nrecommended that the Commission should set the notional cap size at the \\nblock threshold, as the added public dissemination could harm liquidity \\nin the same manner that a higher block trade size threshold might.\\\\486\\\\ \\nVanguard believes that it is essential that the cap match the block \\ntrade threshold, as to do otherwise would compromise the liquidity \\nprotections afforded by the nuanced assessment of block trade \\nthresholds.\\\\487\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\481\\\\ CL-AII at 12.\\n    \\\\482\\\\ CL-GFMA at 5.\\n    \\\\483\\\\ CL-ICI at 8.\\n    \\\\484\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 15.\\n    \\\\485\\\\ CL-MFA at 8-9.\\n    \\\\486\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 12.\\n    \\\\487\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Two other commenters suggested alterations of the Commission\\'s \\nproposed cap sizes. Barclays recommended that the post-initial period \\ncap sizes be introduced at more nuanced levels that reflect the \\ndifferences between product\\'s traded volumes.\\\\488\\\\ EEI recommended a \\nmuch lower fixed cap size for Electricity Swap Contracts and the Other \\nCommodity Electricity Swap Category.\\\\489\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\488\\\\ CL-Barclays at 6.\\n    \\\\489\\\\ CL-EEI at 11-12.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments above, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.4(h)(2)(ii) as proposed. The Commission is of the \\nview that setting post-initial cap sizes above appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes would provide additional pricing information with respect \\nto large swap transactions, which are large enough to be treated as \\nblock trades (or large notional off-facility swaps), but small enough \\nthat they do not exceed the applicable post-\\n\\n[[Page 32909]]\\n\\ninitial cap size. This additional information may enhance price \\ndiscovery by publicly disseminating more information relating to market \\ndepth and the notional sizes of publicly reportable swap transactions, \\nwhile still protecting the anonymity of swap counterparties and their \\nability to lay off risk when executing extraordinarily large swap \\ntransactions.\\n    The Commission notes that Section 2(a)(13) tasks the Commission \\nwith bringing real-time public reporting to the swaps market. Section \\n2(a)(13)(E) expressly provides that the Commission determine \\nappropriate time delays for block trades and large notional off-\\nfacility swaps. However, these provisions only call for a time delay--\\nthey do not provide for information to be kept from the market in \\nperpetuity. All of the information regarding a block trade is reported \\nto the market at the end of the block time delay. Cap sizes, on the \\nother hand, are never expressed to the market. Because this information \\nis not reported to the market in real-time, nor reported to the market \\nat all, the Commission believes that cap sizes should be set at a \\nhigher level than block sizes. The 75 percent notional test balances \\nthe competing interests of providing meaningful real-time public \\nreporting to the swaps market and protecting the anonymity of swap \\nmarket participants, while taking into account potential impacts on \\nmarket liquidity.\\n    If market participants conclude that the Commission has set cap \\nsizes for a specific swap category in a way that will materially reduce \\nmarket liquidity, then those participants are encouraged to submit data \\nto support their conclusion. In addition, through its own surveillance \\nof swaps market activity, the Commission may become aware that a cap \\nsize would reduce market liquidity for a specific swap category. In \\nresponse to either a submission or its own surveillance of swaps market \\nactivity, the Commission has the legal authority to take action by rule \\nor order to mitigate the potential effects on market liquidity of cap \\nsizes with respect to swaps in a particular swap category.\\n\\nC. Masking the Geographic Detail of Swaps in the Other Commodity Asset \\nClass\\n\\n1. Policy Goals for Masking the Geographic Detail for Swaps in the \\nOther Commodity Asset Class\\n    In the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission sets forth \\ngeneral protections for the identities, market positions and business \\ntransactions of swap counterparties in Sec.  43.4(d). Section 43.4(d) \\ngenerally prohibits an SDR from publicly disseminating swap transaction \\nand pricing data in a manner that discloses or otherwise facilitates \\nthe identification of a swap counterparty.\\\\490\\\\ Notwithstanding that \\nprohibition, Sec.  43.4(d)(3) provides that SDRs are required to \\npublicly disseminate data that discloses the underlying asset(s) of \\npublicly reportable swap transactions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\490\\\\ See Sec.  43.4(d)(1) of the Commission\\'s regulations.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section 43.4(d)(4) contains special provisions for swaps in the \\nother commodity asset class. These swaps raise special concerns because \\nthe public disclosure of the underlying asset(s) may in turn reveal the \\nidentities, market positions and business transactions of the swap \\ncounterparties. To address these concerns, Sec.  43.4(d)(4) limits the \\ntypes of swaps in the other commodity asset class that are subject to \\npublic dissemination. Specifically, Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations provides that, for publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions in the other commodity asset class, SDRs must publicly \\ndisseminate the actual underlying assets only for: (1) those swaps \\nexecuted on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM; (2) those swaps \\nreferencing one of the contracts described in appendix B to part 43; \\nand (3) those swaps that are economically related to one of the \\ncontracts described in appendix B to part 43.\\\\491\\\\ Essentially, the \\nCommission has determined that these three categories of swap have \\nsufficient liquidity such that the disclosure of the underlying asset \\nwould not reveal the identities, market positions and business \\ntransactions of the swap counterparties.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\491\\\\ Appendix B to part 43 provides a list of 28 ``Enumerated \\nPhysical Commodity Contracts\\'\\' as well as 1 contract under the \\n``Other Contracts\\'\\' heading. See 77 FR 1182 app. B.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In its Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission included in \\nappendix B to part 43 a list of contracts that, if referenced as an \\nunderlying asset, should be publicly disseminated in full without \\nlimiting the commodity or geographic detail of the asset. In the \\nFurther Block Proposal, the Commission proposed adding 13 contracts to \\nappendix B to part 43 under the ``Other Contracts\\'\\' heading.\\\\492\\\\ The \\nCommission believes that since it previously has determined that these \\n13 contracts have material liquidity and price references, among other \\nthings, the public dissemination of the full underlying asset for \\npublicly reportable swap transactions that reference such contracts \\n(and any underlying assets that are economically related thereto) would \\nnot disclose the identities, market positions and business transactions \\nof swap counterparties.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\492\\\\ Appendix B to part 43 currently lists only Brent Crude Oil \\n(ICE) under the ``Other Contracts\\'\\' heading.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Pursuant to the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, any publicly \\nreportable swap transaction in the other commodity asset class that is \\nexcluded under Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) would not be subject to the \\nreporting and public dissemination requirements for part 43 upon the \\neffective date of the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule. The Commission \\nnoted in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule that it planned to address \\nthe group of other commodity swaps that were not subject to the rules \\nof part 43 in a forthcoming release.\\\\493\\\\ Accordingly, the Commission \\nproposed in the Further Block Proposal to address the public \\ndissemination of swap transaction and pricing data for the group of \\nother commodity swaps that are not covered currently by Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(ii).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\493\\\\ See 77 FR 1211.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is of the view that given the lack of data on the \\nliquidity for certain swaps in the other commodity asset class, the \\nlack of data on the number of market participants in these other \\ncommodity swaps markets, and the statutory requirement to protect the \\nanonymity of market participants,\\\\494\\\\ the public dissemination of less \\nspecific information for swaps with specific geographic or pricing \\ndetail may be appropriate. The Commission believes that the public \\ndissemination of the exact underlying assets for swaps in this group of \\nthe other commodity asset class may subject the identities, market \\npositions and business transactions of market participants to \\nunwarranted public disclosure if additional protections are not \\nestablished with respect to the geographic detail of the underlying \\nasset. For that reason, the Commission proposed that SDRs mask or \\notherwise disguise the geographic details related to the underlying \\nassets of a swap in connection with the public dissemination of such \\nswap transaction and pricing data.\\\\495\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\494\\\\ See sections 2(a)(13)(E)(i) and 2(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the \\nCEA. 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(13)(C)(iii), (E)(i).\\n    \\\\495\\\\ Limiting the geographical detail is a typical statistical \\ndisclosure control used by other federal agencies as described in \\nthe Report on Statistical Disclosure Limitation Methodology. See \\nsupra note 61.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Proposed Amendments to Sec.  43.4\\n    In order to accommodate the policy goals described above, the \\nCommission proposed adding Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) to part 43 to \\nestablish rules regarding the\\n\\n[[Page 32910]]\\n\\npublic dissemination of the remaining group of swaps in the other \\ncommodity asset class (i.e., those not described in Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(ii)). In the Commission\\'s view, proposed Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(iii) would ensure that the public dissemination of swap \\ntransaction and pricing data would not unintentionally disclose the \\nidentities, market positions and business transactions of any swap \\ncounterparty to a publicly reportable swap transaction in the other \\ncommodity asset class. In particular, proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) \\nprovides that SDRs must publicly disseminate the details about the \\ngeographic location of the underlying assets of the other commodity \\nswaps not described in Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) (i.e., other commodity \\nswaps that have a specific delivery or pricing point) pursuant to \\nproposed appendix E to part 43. Proposed appendix E to part 43 is \\ndiscussed in the next subsection.\\n    The Commission recognizes that requiring the public dissemination \\nof less specific geographic detail for an other commodity swap may, to \\nsome extent, diminish the price discovery value of swap transaction and \\npricing data for such swap. The Commission believes, however, that the \\npublic dissemination of such data will still provide the market with \\nuseful information relating to market depth, trading activity and \\npricing information for similar types of swaps.\\n    The Commission also proposed making conforming amendments to Sec.  \\n43.4(d). Specifically, the Commission proposed amending the \\nintroductory language to Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(i) by deleting ``Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(ii)\\'\\' and adding in its place ``Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) and \\n(iii)\\'\\' to make clear that SDRs have to publicly disseminate swaps data \\nunder Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) in accordance with part 43.\\\\496\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\496\\\\ In addition to proposing limitations on the geographic \\ndetail for public dissemination of underlying assets for certain \\nswaps in the other commodity asset class, the Commission also \\nproposed amending Sec.  43.4(g) and (h) to make conforming changes.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received no comments regarding Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(i) \\nand (ii). The Commission is adopting Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(i) and (ii) as \\nproposed.\\n3. Application of Proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) and Proposed Appendix \\nE to Part 43--Geographic Detail for Delivery or Pricing Points\\n    Proposed appendix E to part 43 includes the system that SDRs would \\nbe required to use to mask the specific delivery or pricing points that \\nare a part of an underlying asset in connection with the public \\ndissemination of swap transaction and pricing data for certain swaps in \\nthe other commodity asset class. To the extent that the underlying \\nasset of a publicly reportable swap transaction described in proposed \\nSec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) does not have a specific delivery or pricing \\npoint, the provisions of proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) and proposed \\nappendix E to part 43 would not apply. Specifically, proposed appendix \\nE to part 43 provides top-coding for various geographic regions, both \\nin the United States and internationally.\\n    Subsection (a) below includes a description of the top-coding U.S. \\nregions. Subsection (b) below includes a description of the top-coding \\nnon-U.S. regions. Finally, subsection (c) below outlines the proposed \\nsystem for SDRs to publicly disseminate ``basis swaps.\\'\\'\\\\497\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\497\\\\ For the purposes of the Further Block Proposal and this \\nfinal rule, basis swaps are defined as swap transactions in which \\none leg of the swap references a contract described in appendix B to \\npart 43 (or is economically related thereto) and the other leg of \\nthe swap does not.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\na. U.S. Delivery or Pricing Points\\n    Table E1 in proposed appendix E to part 43 lists the geographic \\nregions that an SDR would publicly disseminate for an off-facility swap \\nin the other commodity asset class that is described in proposed Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(iii). The Commission proposed that an SDR publicly \\ndisseminate swap transaction and pricing data for certain energy and \\npower swaps in the other commodity asset class, as described in more \\ndetail below, in a different manner than the remaining other \\ncommodities. In order to mask the specific delivery or pricing detail \\nof these energy and power swaps, the Commission proposed using \\nestablished regions or markets that are associated with these \\nunderlying assets.\\ni. Natural Gas and Related Products\\n    In proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) and proposed appendix E to part \\n43, the Commission set forth a method to describe the publicly \\nreportable swap transactions that have natural gas or related products \\nas an underlying asset and have a specific delivery or pricing point in \\nthe United States. In particular, the proposal required SDRs to \\npublicly disseminate a description of the specific delivery or pricing \\npoint based on one of the five industry specific natural gas markets \\nset forth by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC\\'\\').\\\\498\\\\ \\nThe FERC Natural Gas Markets reflect natural deviations found in the \\nspot prices in different markets.\\\\499\\\\ The Commission anticipates that \\na distinction for natural gas is necessary to enhance price discovery \\nwhile protecting the identities of the parties, business transactions \\nand market positions of market participants.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\498\\\\ See FERC, National Gas Markets--Overview, <a href=\"http://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/mkt-gas/overview.asp\">http://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/mkt-gas/overview.asp</a> (last viewed May \\n6, 2013).\\n    \\\\499\\\\ See FERC, Natural Gas Market Overview: Spot Gas Prices, \\n<a href=\"http://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/mkt-gas/overview/ngas-ovr-avg-spt-ng-pr.pdf\">http://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/mkt-gas/overview/ngas-ovr-avg-spt-ng-pr.pdf</a> (updated Jan.10, 2013). In addition, there is evidence \\nthat the spot prices in these markets and the corresponding futures \\nprices are highly correlated. D. Murray, Z. Zhu, ``Asymmetric price \\nresponses, market integration and market power: A study of the U.S. \\nnatural gas market,\\'\\' Energy Economics, 30 (2008) 748-65.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The proposed five markets for public dissemination of delivery or \\npricing points for natural gas swaps are as follows: (i) Midwest \\n(including North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, \\nIndiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and \\nArkansas); (ii) Northeast (including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, \\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, \\nPennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, New Jersey, Delaware, \\nMaryland and Virginia); \\\\500\\\\ (iii) Gulf (including Louisiana and \\nTexas); (iv) Southeast (including Tennessee, North Carolina, South \\nCarolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi); and (v) Western \\n(including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, \\nWashington, Oregon, California, Nevada and Arizona). For any other \\npricing points in the United States, SDRs would publicly disseminate \\n``Other U.S.\\'\\' in place of the actual pricing or delivery point for \\nsuch natural gas swaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\500\\\\ The District of Columbia would be included in this region, \\nif any specific delivery or pricing points existed at the time of \\nthe Further Block Proposal.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nii. Petroleum and Related Products\\n    In proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) and proposed appendix E to part \\n43, the Commission set forth a method to describe the publicly \\nreportable swap transactions that have petroleum or related products as \\nan underlying asset and have a specific delivery or pricing point in \\nthe United States. In particular, the proposal would require SDRs to \\npublicly disseminate a description of the specific delivery or pricing \\npoint based on one of the seven Petroleum Administration for Defense \\nDistricts (``PADD\\'\\') regions.\\\\501\\\\ The PADD regions indicate \\neconomically and geographically distinct regions for the purposes of \\nadministering oil allocation.\\n\\n[[Page 32911]]\\n\\nThe Department of Energy\\'s Energy Information Administration (``EIA\\'\\') \\ncollects and publishes oil supply and demand data with respect to the \\nPADD regions.\\\\502\\\\ Accordingly, to provide consistency with EIA \\npublications and information regarding regional patterns, the \\nCommission proposed that specific delivery or pricing points with \\nrespect to such petroleum product swaps are publicly disseminated based \\non PADD regions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\501\\\\ See PADD Map, Appendix A, Petroleum Administration for \\nDefense Districts, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=4890\">http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=4890</a>, (last viewed May 6, 2013).\\n    \\\\502\\\\ See U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)--\\nPetroleum & Other Liquids, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/data.cfm\">http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/data.cfm</a> \\n(last viewed May 6, 2013).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The PADD regions for public dissemination of delivery or pricing \\npoints for such petroleum product swaps are as follows: (i) PADD 1A \\n(New England); (ii) PADD 1B (Central Atlantic); (iii) PADD 1C (Lower \\nAtlantic); (iv) PADD 2 (Midwest); (v) PADD 3 (Gulf Coast); (vi) PADD 4 \\n(Rocky Mountains); and (vii) PADD 5 (West Coast).\\\\503\\\\ For any other \\npricing points in the United States, SDRs would publicly disseminate \\nthe term ``Other U.S.\\'\\' in place of the actual pricing or delivery \\npoint for such petroleum product swaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\503\\\\ Alternatively, the Commission is considering combining the \\nEast Coast PADD into one category, such that any oil swap with a \\nspecific delivery or pricing point as PADD 1A (New England), PADD 1B \\n(Central Atlantic) or PADD 1C (Lower Atlantic) would be publicly \\ndisseminated as PADD 1 (East Coast).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\niii. Electricity and Sources\\n    In proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii), the Commission also set forth a \\nmethod to describe publicly reportable swap transactions that have \\nelectricity and sources as an underlying asset and have a specific \\ndelivery or pricing point in the United States. In particular, the \\nproposal would require SDRs to publicly disseminate the specific \\ndelivery or pricing point based on a description of one of the FERC \\nElectric Power Markets.\\\\504\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\504\\\\ See FERC, Electric Power Markets--Overview, <a href=\"http://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/mkt-electric/overview.asp\">http://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/mkt-electric/overview.asp</a> (last viewed \\nMay 6, 2013).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The markets for public dissemination of delivery or pricing points \\nfor such electricity swaps are as follows: (i) California (CAISO); (ii) \\nMidwest (MISO); (iii) New England (ISO-NE); (iv) New York (NYISO); (v) \\nNorthwest; (vi) Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM); (vii) \\nSoutheast; (viii) Southwest; (ix) Southwest Power Pool (SPP); and (x) \\nTexas (ERCOT). For any other pricing points in the United States, SDRs \\nwould publicly disseminate the term ``Other U.S.\\'\\' in place of the \\nactual pricing or delivery point for such electricity and sources \\nswaps.\\niv. All Remaining Other Commodities\\n    In proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) and proposed appendix E to part \\n43, the Commission set forth a method to describe any swaps in the \\nother commodity asset class that do not have oil, natural gas, \\nelectricity, or petroleum as an underlying asset, but have specific \\ndelivery or pricing points in the United States. In particular, the \\nCommission proposed that SDRs publicly disseminate information with \\nrespect to these swaps based on the 10 federal regions established by \\nthe U.S. Energy Information Administration (``EIA\\'\\'). The Commission \\nbelieved that the use of the 10 federal regions would provide \\nconsistency among different types of underlying assets in the other \\ncommodity asset class with respect to delivery and pricing point \\ndescriptions.\\n    The 10 federal regions that SDRs would use for public dissemination \\nunder the proposal for all remaining other commodity swaps are as \\nfollows: (i) Region I (including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New \\nHampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont); (ii) Region II (including New \\nJersey and New York); (iii) Region III (including Delaware, District of \\nColumbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia); (iv) \\nRegion IV (including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, \\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee); (v) Region V (including \\nIllinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin); (vi) \\nRegion VI (including Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and \\nTexas); (vii) Region VII (including Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and \\nNebraska); (viii) Region VIII (including Colorado, Montana, North \\nDakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming); (ix) Region IX (including \\nArizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada); and (x) Region X (including \\nAlaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington).\\\\505\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\505\\\\ See U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Federal \\nRegion Map, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/regionsmap/fedregstates.html\">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/regionsmap/fedregstates.html</a> (last visited May 6, 2013).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb. Non-U.S. Delivery or Pricing Points\\n    Table E2 in proposed appendix E to part 43 provided the appropriate \\nmanner for SDRs to publicly disseminate non-U.S. delivery or pricing \\npoints for all publicly reportable swap transactions described in the \\nproposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii). The Commission is of the view that SDRs \\nshould not publicly disseminate the actual location for these \\ninternational delivery or pricing points since the public disclosure of \\nsuch information may disclose the identities of parties, business \\ntransactions and market positions of market participants. In Table E2, \\nthe Commission proposed the countries and regions that an SDR must \\npublicly disseminate. In proposing the use of these geographic \\nbreakdowns for the public reporting of international delivery or \\npricing points, the Commission considered world regions that have \\nsignificant energy consumption, whether ISDA-specific documentation \\nexists for a particular country, and whether public disclosure would \\ncompromise the anonymity of the swap counterparties.\\n    The Commission proposed the following international regions for \\npublicly disseminating specific delivery or pricing points of publicly \\nreportable swap transactions described in Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii): (i) \\nNorth America (publicly disseminate ``Canada\\'\\' or ``Mexico\\'\\'); (ii) \\nCentral America (publicly disseminate ``Central America\\'\\'); (iii) South \\nAmerica (publicly disseminate ``Brazil\\'\\' or ``Other South America\\'\\'); \\n(iv) Europe (publicly disseminate ``Western Europe,\\'\\' ``Northern \\nEurope,\\'\\' ``Southern Europe,\\'\\' or ``Eastern Europe\\'\\'); (v) Russia \\n(publicly disseminate ``Russia\\'\\'); \\\\506\\\\ (vi) Africa (publicly \\ndisseminate ``Northern Africa,\\'\\' ``Western Africa,\\'\\' ``Eastern \\nAfrica,\\'\\' ``Central Africa,\\'\\' or ``Southern Africa\\'\\'); (vii) Asia-\\nPacific (publicly disseminate ``Northern Asia,\\'\\' ``Central Asia,\\'\\' \\n``Eastern Asia,\\'\\' ``Western Asia,\\'\\' ``Southeast Asia,\\'\\' or ``Australia/\\nNew Zealand/Pacific Islands\\'\\'). The Commission considered whether a \\nmore granular approach is necessary for certain regions in order to \\nenhance price discovery while still protecting anonymity. For example, \\nMexico, Canada and Russia may benefit from a more granular public \\ndissemination of delivery or pricing points given the amount of energy \\nproduction in those regions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\506\\\\ Note that Russia is not included in ``Eastern Europe\\'\\' or \\nin ``Northern Asia\\'\\' and instead should be publicly disseminated as \\n``Russia.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To the extent that a publicly reportable swap transaction described \\nin proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) references the United States as a \\nwhole and not a specific delivery or pricing point, proposed appendix E \\nwould require an SDR to publicly disseminate that reference. For \\nexample, an SDR would publicly disseminate a weather swap that \\nreferences ``U.S. Heating Monthly\\'\\' as ``U.S. Heating Monthly.\\'\\'\\nc. Basis Swaps\\n    The Commission proposed requiring SDRs to ensure that specific \\nunderlying assets are publicly disseminated for basis swaps that \\nqualify as publicly\\n\\n[[Page 32912]]\\n\\nreportable swap transactions. The Commission recognizes that basis \\nswaps exist in which one leg of the swap references a contract \\ndescribed in appendix B to part 43 (or is economically related to one \\nsuch contract) and the other leg of the swap references an asset or \\npricing point not listed in appendix B to part 43. Currently, Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(ii)(A)-(B) requires an SDR to publicly disseminate the \\nactual underlying asset of the leg of the basis swap that references or \\nis economically related to a contract listed in appendix B to part 43. \\nTo the extent that a basis swap is executed on or pursuant to the rules \\nof a SEF or DCM, an SDR would also publicly disseminate the specific \\nunderlying asset. With respect to the leg of a basis swap that does not \\nreference a contract in appendix B to part 43, however, the Commission \\nproposed to require SDRs to publicly disseminate the underlying asset \\nof that leg pursuant to proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) and proposed \\nappendix E to part 43, i.e., with top-coding provisions.\\nd. Comments Received and Commission Determination\\n    The Commission received three comments regarding the masking of \\nspecific delivery or pricing detail of energy and power swaps. EEI \\nrecommended that the Commission mask data regarding Other Commodity \\nElectricity Swaps according to the North American Electric Reliability \\nCorporation eight regions rather than the FERC regions proposed.\\\\507\\\\ \\nBarclays recommended that the Commission use wider geographic regions \\nwhen publicly disseminating data for commodity swaps with very specific \\nunderlying assets and/or delivery points and develop an appropriate \\nprocess to avoid identifying issuers of debt.\\\\508\\\\ Spring Trading \\nsupported further measures to prevent public disclosure of identities, \\nbusiness transactions, and market positions of swap market \\nparticipants, and recommended disclosing a subset of data on a \\ncollective basis at a later date.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\507\\\\ CL-EEI at 12-13.\\n    \\\\508\\\\ CL-Barclays at 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) with the following modification. For \\npublicly reportable swap transactions that have electricity and sources \\nas an underlying asset and have a specific delivery or pricing point in \\nthe United States, the Commission is requiring SDRs to publicly \\ndisseminate the specific delivery or pricing point based on a \\ndescription of one of the North American Electric Reliability \\nCorporation (``NERC\\'\\') regions for publicly disseminating delivery or \\npricing points for electricity swaps described in proposed Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(iii). The NERC regions are broader than the FERC regions and \\ninclude much of Canada. Specifically, the NERC regions are as follows: \\n(i) Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC); (ii) Midwest \\nReliability Organization (MRO); (iii) Northeast Power Coordinating \\nCouncil (NPCC); (iv) ReliabilityFirst Corporation (RFC); (v) SERC \\nReliability Corporation (SERC); (vi) Southwest Power Pool, RE (SPP); \\n(vii) Texas Regional Entity (TRE); (viii) Western Electricity \\nCoordinating Council (WECC).\\\\509\\\\ The Commission is of the view that \\nusing these regions as suggested by EEI will provide further masking of \\nspecific delivery details and thus further protection against public \\ndisclosure of identities, business transactions, and market positions \\nof swap market participants, as recommended by Barclays and Spring \\nTrading.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\509\\\\ See NERC, Key Players: Regional Entities, <a href=\"http://www.nerc.com/page.php?cid=1%7C9%7C119\">http://www.nerc.com/page.php?cid=1%7C9%7C119</a> (last visited May 6, 2013).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n4. Further Revisions to Part 43\\na. Additional Contracts Added to Appendix B to Part 43\\n    Appendix B to part 43 currently lists contracts that, if referenced \\nas an underlying asset, would require SDRs to publicly disseminate the \\nfull geographic detail of the asset. In the Real-Time Reporting Final \\nRule, the Commission provided that SDRs were required to publicly \\ndisseminate any underlying asset of a publicly reportable swap \\ntransaction that references or is economically related to any contract \\nor contracts listed in appendix B to part 43 in the same manner.\\n    As noted above, the Commission proposed adding 13 natural gas and \\nelectricity contracts under the ``Other Commodity\\'\\' heading in appendix \\nB to part 43 that have been de-listed and converted into futures \\ncontracts listed on a DCM.\\\\510\\\\ Nevertheless, the addition of these 13 \\ncontracts to appendix B effectively would require SDRs to publicly \\ndisseminate these contracts the same way as the other contracts that \\nare currently listed in appendix B to part 43. That is, an SDR would \\npublicly disseminate the actual underlying asset (and any underlying \\nasset(s) that are economically related) without any limitation of the \\ngeographic detail.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\510\\\\ See supra note 176.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission had previously determined that these 13 contracts--\\nas swaps--were significant price discovery contracts (``SPDCs\\'\\') in \\nconnection with trading on exempt commercial markets (``ECMs\\'\\').\\\\511\\\\ \\nEach of the 13 contracts had undergone an analysis in which the \\nCommission considered the following five criteria: (i) Price linkage \\n(the extent to which the contract uses or otherwise relies on a daily \\nor final settlement price of a contract listed for trade on or subject \\nto the rules of a DCM); (ii) arbitrage (the extent to which the price \\nof the contract is sufficiently related to the price of a contract \\nlisted on a DCM to permit market participants to effectively arbitrage \\nbetween the two markets); (iii) material price reference (the extent to \\nwhich, on a frequent and recurring basis, bids, offers or transactions \\nin a commodity are directly based on, or are determined by referencing, \\nthe prices generated by contracts being traded or executed on the ECM); \\n(iv) material liquidity (the extent to which volume of the contract is \\nsufficient to have a material effect on other contracts listed for \\ntrading); and (v) other material factors.\\\\512\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\511\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\512\\\\ The Dodd-Frank Act deleted and replaced CEA section \\n2(h)(7), which contained the five criteria for determining a SPDC. \\nThe Dodd-Frank Act amended CEA section 4a(a) to include CEA section \\n4a(a)(4), which contains a similar version of the five criteria for \\ndetermining a SPDC in the context of excessive speculation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To the extent that the SPDC contracts have been de-listed and \\nreplaced by listed futures contracts, the Commission believes that the \\nlatter contracts have similar material liquidity and material price \\nreference, among other things. Therefore, the Commission anticipates \\nthat, the public dissemination of the full underlying asset for \\npublicly reportable swap transactions that reference such futures \\ncontracts (and any underlying assets that are economically related \\nthereto) would not disclose the identities, market positions and \\nbusiness transactions of market participants and would enhance price \\ndiscovery in the related markets.\\\\513\\\\ The Commission did not receive \\nany other comments, and accordingly, is adopting these additions to \\nappendix B.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\513\\\\ The Commission notes that it is not adding ``Henry \\nFinancial LD1 Fixed Price,\\'\\' a listed futures contract that was \\nconverted from ``Henry Financial LD1 Fixed Price Swap\\'\\' (which was \\npreviously deemed by the Commission to be a SPDC), to appendix B to \\npart 43. This contract is economically related to the ``New York \\nMercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas,\\'\\' which is listed under \\n``Enumerated Physical Commodity Contracts\\'\\' in appendix B to part \\n43. Therefore, listing this contract again would be redundant.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb. Technical Revisions to Part 43\\n    In the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission states that \\nthe\\n\\n[[Page 32913]]\\n\\ntransactions described Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii)(A)-(C), i.e., the instances \\nin which the actual underlying asset for a publicly reportable swap \\ntransaction in the other commodity asset class is to be publicly \\ndisseminated, are meant to be exclusive of one another. Under these \\nsections, an SDR is required to publicly disseminate the actual \\nunderlying asset(s) of a swap in the other commodity asset class, where \\nthe swap (1) is executed on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM; \\n(2) references a contract listed on appendix B to part 43; or (3) is \\neconomically related to a contract on appendix B. Accordingly, the \\nCommission proposed a technical clarification to Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(ii)(B) to clarify the intent that these elements are \\nexclusive of one another, as articulated in the preamble to the Real-\\nTime Reporting Final Rule.\\n    The Commission did not receive any comments regarding the technical \\nclarification to Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii)(B). Accordingly, the Commission \\nis adopting Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii)(B) as proposed.\\n\\nIV. Paperwork Reduction Act\\n\\nA. Background\\n\\n    The purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 \\net seq. (``PRA\\'\\') are, among other things, to minimize the paperwork \\nburden to the private sector, ensure that any collection of information \\nby a government agency is put to the greatest possible uses, and \\nminimize duplicative information collections across the \\ngovernment.\\\\514\\\\ The PRA applies with extraordinary breadth to all \\ninformation, ``regardless of form or format,\\'\\' whenever the government \\nis ``obtaining, causing to be obtained [or] soliciting\\'\\' information, \\nand includes required ``disclosure to third parties or the public, of \\nfacts or opinions,\\'\\' when the information collection calls for \\n``answers to identical questions posed to, or identical reporting or \\nrecordkeeping requirements imposed on, ten or more persons.\\'\\' \\\\515\\\\ The \\nPRA requirements have been determined to include not only mandatory but \\nalso voluntary information collections, and include both written and \\noral communications.\\\\516\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\514\\\\ See 44 U.S.C. 3501.\\n    \\\\515\\\\ See 44 U.S.C. 3502.\\n    \\\\516\\\\ See 5 CFR 1320.3(c)(1).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To effectuate the purposes of the PRA, Congress requires all \\nagencies to quantify and justify the burden of any information \\ncollection it imposes.\\\\517\\\\ This requirement includes submitting each \\ncollection, whether or not it is contained in a rulemaking, to the \\nOffice of Management and Budget (``OMB\\'\\') for review. The OMB \\nsubmission process included completing a supporting statement with the \\nagency\\'s burden estimate and justification for the collection. The \\ninformation collection established within this rulemaking, which \\nincluded the agency\\'s burden estimate and justification, was subjected \\nto the rulemaking\\'s public comment process. No public comments were \\nreceived affecting the information burden and justification.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\517\\\\ See 44 U.S.C. 3506.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section 43.6 and amendments to Sec.  43.4 amend an existing \\ncollection of information within the meaning of the PRA in two \\nrespects. Accordingly, the Commission submitted the Further Block \\nProposal to the OMB for review pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 \\nCFR1320.11. OMB has assigned control number 3038-0070 to the existing \\ncollection of information, which is titled ``Part 43--Real-Time Public \\nReporting.\\'\\' The Commission invited the public to comment on any aspect \\nof the proposed amendments to existing collections of information. The \\nresponses to this amended collection of information are mandatory. The \\nCommission did not receive any comments regarding the proposed \\namendments. Accordingly, the Commission is not revising the estimates \\ncontained in the Further Block Proposal, which are described in the \\nfollowing sections.\\n\\nB. Description of the Collection\\n\\n    On January 9, 2012, the Commission issued the Real-Time Reporting \\nFinal Rule, which includes three collections of information \\nrequirements within the meaning of the PRA. The first collection of \\ninformation requirement under Part 43 imposed a reporting requirement \\non a SEF or DCM when a swap is executed on a trading facility or on the \\nparties to a swap transaction when the swap is executed bilaterally. \\nThe second collection of information requirement under Part 43 created \\na public dissemination requirement on SDRs. The third collection of \\ninformation requirement created a recordkeeping requirement for SEFs, \\nDCMs, SDRs and any reporting party (as such term is defined in part 43 \\nof the Commission\\'s regulations).\\n    Sections 43.4 and 43.6 amend the first and second collections of \\ninformation within the meaning of the PRA as described below. The \\nanalysis with respect to the amended collections as a result of Sec.  \\n43.6 is set out in section 1 below. The analysis with respect to the \\namended collections as a result of amendments to Sec.  43.4 is set out \\nin section 2 below.\\n1. Sec.  43.6(g)--Notification of Election\\n    Section 43.6(g) amends the first and second collections of \\ninformation within the meaning of the PRA. In particular, Sec.  43.6(g) \\ncontains the provisions regarding the election to have a swap \\ntransaction treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility \\nswap, as applicable. Section 43.6(g)(1) establishes a two-step \\nnotification process relating to block trades. Section 43.6(g)(2) \\nestablishes the notification process relating to large notional off-\\nfacility swaps. Section 43.6(g) is an essential part of this rulemaking \\nbecause it provides the mechanism through which market participants \\nwill be able to elect to treat their qualifying swap transaction as a \\nblock trade or large notional off-facility swap.\\n    Section 43.6(g)(1)(i) contains the first step in the two-step \\nnotification process relating to block trades. In particular, this \\nsection provides that the parties to a swap that are executed at or \\nabove the appropriate minimum block size for the applicable swap \\ncategory are required to notify the SEF or DCM (as applicable) of their \\nelection to have their qualifying swap transaction treated as a block \\ntrade. The Commission understands that SEFs and DCMs use automated, \\nelectronic, and in some cases, voice processes to execute swap \\ntransactions; therefore, the transmission of the notification of a \\nblock trade election also would either be automated, electronic or \\ncommunicated through voice.\\n    The Commission estimates that there are 125 SDs and MSPs, and 1,000 \\nother non-financial end-user parties.\\\\518\\\\ The Commission estimates \\nthat, on average, SD/MSP reporting parties would likely notify a SEF or \\nDCM of a block trade election approximately 1,000 times per year while \\nnon-SD/MSP reporting parties likely would notify a SEF or DCM of a \\nblock trade election approximately five times per year.\\\\519\\\\ Thus, the \\nCommission estimates that there would be 130,000 notifications of a \\nblock trade election by reporting parties under Sec.  43.6(g) each \\nyear.\\\\520\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\518\\\\ The Commission has previously estimated that 125 SDs and \\nMSPs will register with the Commission and 1,000 non-financial end-\\nusers (i.e., non-SD/non-MSPs) will be required to report swap \\ntransactions annually. 77 FR 1229-30.\\n    \\\\519\\\\ The Commission anticipates that these figures will change \\nas a function of changes in the market structure and practices in \\nthe U.S. swaps markets.\\n    \\\\520\\\\ The Commission estimates the total number of notifications \\nas follows: 125 SDs/MSPs x 1,000 notifications = 125,000 \\nnotifications per year; 1,000 non-SDs/non-MSPs x 5 notifications = \\n5,000 notifications per year; therefore, the total across all types \\nof entities would be 130,000 notifications per year.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 32914]]\\n\\n    The Commission estimates that the burden hours associated with \\nSec.  43.6(g)(1)(i) would include: (i) 30 seconds on average for \\nparties to a swap to determine whether a particular swap transaction \\nqualifies as a block trade based on the appropriate minimum block size \\nof the applicable swap category; and (ii) 30 seconds on average for the \\nparties to electronically transmit or otherwise communicate their \\nnotice of election. SDs, MSPs and reporting parties would use existing \\ntraders (or other professionals earning similar salaries) to \\nelectronically transmit or otherwise communicate their notice of \\nelection. Based on the Securities Industry and Financial Market \\nAssociation\\'s 2011 Securities Industry Salary Survey, the Commission \\nestimates that these block traders would earn approximately $184.90 per \\nhour in total compensation.\\\\521\\\\ Accordingly, the Commission estimates \\nthat the total annual burden hour costs associated with the first step \\nin proposed Sec.  43.6(g)(1)(i) would be 2,167 hours \\\\522\\\\ or $400,678 \\nin total annual burden hours costs \\\\523\\\\ and $11.8 million in total \\nstart-up capital costs.\\\\524\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\521\\\\ The Commission previously has utilized wage rate estimates \\nbased on average salary and average prior year bonus information for \\nthe securities industry compiled by SIFMA. These wage estimates are \\nderived from an industry-wide survey of participants and thus \\nreflect an average across entities; the Commission notes that the \\nactual costs for any individual company or sector may vary from the \\naverage.\\n    The Commission estimated the dollar costs of hourly burdens for \\ndifferent types of relevant professionals using the following \\ncalculations:\\n    (1) [(2010 salary + bonus) * (salary growth per professional \\ntype, 2010-2011)] = Estimated 2010 total annual compensation. The \\nmost recent data provided by the SIFMA report describe the 2010 \\ntotal compensation (salary + bonus) by professional type, the growth \\nin base salary from 2010 to 2011 for each professional type, and the \\n2011 base salary for each professional type; therefore, the \\nCommission estimated the 2011 total compensation for each \\nprofessional type, but, in the absence of similarly granular data on \\nsalary growth or compensation from 2011 to 2012 and beyond, did not \\nestimate dollar costs beyond 2011. [(Estimated 2011 total annual \\ncompensation)/(1,800 annual work hours)] = Hourly wage per \\nprofessional type.]\\n    (2) [(Hourly wage) * (Adjustment factor for overhead and other \\nbenefits, which the Commission has estimated to be 1.3)] = Adjusted \\nhourly wage per professional type.]\\n    (3) [(Adjusted hourly wage) * (Estimated hour burden for \\ncompliance)] = Dollar cost of compliance for each hour burden \\nestimate per professional type.]\\n    The sum of each of these calculations for all professional types \\ninvolved in compliance with a given element of the Further Block \\nProposal represents the total cost for each counterparty, reporting \\nparty, swap dealer, major swap participant, SEF, DCM, or SDR, as \\napplicable to that element of the proposal.\\n    \\\\522\\\\ To comply with the election process in proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(g), a market participant likely would need to provide training \\nto its existing personnel and update its written policies and \\nprocedures to account for this new process. The total annual burden \\nhours equals the total hours for swap dealers and major swap \\nparticipants plus the total hours for non-swap dealers and non-major \\nswap participants.\\n    \\\\523\\\\ The underlying adjusted labor cost estimate of $184.90 per \\nhour used in this estimate is calculated based on the adjusted wages \\nof swap traders. See note 521 supra.\\n    \\\\524\\\\ The estimated costs are based on the Commission\\'s estimate \\nof the incremental, non-recurring expenditures to reporting \\nentities, including non-SD/non-MSPs (i.e., non-financial end-users) \\nto: (1) update existing technology, including updating its OMS \\nsystem ($7,170); and (2) provide training to existing personnel and \\nupdate written policies and procedures ($3,360). See section V.D.1. \\ninfra. The Commission believes that SDs/MSPs would incur similar \\nnon-recurring start-up costs. The Commission has previously \\nestimated that 125 SDs and MSPs will register with the Commission \\nand 1,000 non-financial end-users (i.e., non-SD/non-MSPs) will be \\nrequired to report in a year. See 77 FR 1229-30.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    With respect to the second step, proposed Sec.  43.6(g)(1)(ii) \\nprovides that the SEF or DCM, as applicable, that receives an election \\nnotification is required to notify an SDR of a block trade election \\nwhen transmitting swap transaction and pricing data to such SDR for \\npublic dissemination. As noted above, the Commission anticipates that \\nSEFs and DCMs would use automated, electronic and, in some cases, voice \\nprocesses to execute swap transactions. The Commission estimates that \\nthere will be approximately 58 SEFs and DCMs. Accordingly, the \\nCommission estimates that the total annual burden associated with the \\nsecond step in Sec.  43.6(g)(1)(ii) would be approximately $610,740 in \\nnon-recurring annualized capital and start-up costs.\\\\525\\\\ The Real-Time \\nReporting Final Rule already has addressed the recurring annualized \\ncosts for the hour burden.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\525\\\\ The Commission bases this estimate on 58 projected SEFs \\nand DCMs, each of which will incur costs of investing in update \\ntechnology, including updating its OMS system ($6,761.20); and \\ntraining existing personnel and updating written policies and \\nprocedures ($3,195.00). See section V.D.1. infra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section 43.6(g)(2) is similar to the first step set forth in Sec.  \\n43.6(g)(1). That is, Sec.  43.6(g)(2) provides, in part, that a \\nreporting party who executes a bilateral swap transaction that is at or \\nabove the appropriate minimum block size is required to notify the SDR \\nof its election to treat such swap as a large notional off-facility \\nswap. This section provides further that the reporting party is \\nrequired to notify the SDR in connection with the reporting party\\'s \\ntransmission of swap transaction and pricing data to the SDR for public \\ndissemination. The Commission anticipates that reporting parties may \\nhave various methods through which they will transmit information to \\nSDRs, which would include a large notional off-facility swap election. \\nMost reporting parties would use automated and electronic methods to \\ntransmit this information; other reporting parties, because of the \\nexpense associated with building an electronic infrastructure, may \\ncontract with third parties (including their swap counterparty) to \\ntransmit the notification of a large notional off-facility swap \\nelection.\\n    The Commission estimates that the incremental time and cost burden \\nassociated with the Sec.  43.6(g)(2) would include: (i) One minute for \\na reporting party to determine whether a particular swap transaction \\nqualifies as a large notional off-facility swap based on the \\nappropriate minimum block size of the applicable swap category; and \\n(ii) one minute for the reporting party (or its designee) to \\nelectronically transmit or communicate through voice processes its \\nnotice of election. The Commission estimates that, of the approximately \\n2,250 hours incurred by 125 SDs/MSPs and 1,000 non-SD/MSPs, all of \\nthose hours would be spent by traders and market analysts (or \\ndesignee).\\\\526\\\\ SIFMA\\'s report states that traders and market analysts \\nmake $184.90 per hour in total compensation.\\\\527\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\526\\\\ The economic costs associated with entering into a third \\nparty service arrangement to transmit an electronic notice to an SDR \\nare difficult to determine. There are too many variables that are \\ninvolved in determining those costs. Notwithstanding this \\ndifficulty, the Commission foresees that, for many reporting parties \\nthat infrequently trade swaps, the annualized cost of entering into \\na third-party service arrangement of this type would likely be less \\nthan the total annual cost of building an electronic infrastructure \\nto transmit electronic notices directly to an SDR.\\n    \\\\527\\\\ See note 521 supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission estimates that, on average, each of the estimated \\n125 SD/MSP counterparties would likely notify an SDR of a large \\nnotional off-facility swap election approximately 500 times per year \\nwhile each of the estimated 1,000 non-SD/MSP counterparties would \\nnotify an SDR approximately five times per year. Accordingly, the \\nCommission estimates that there are, on average, approximately 67,500 \\nnotifications large notional off-facility swaps under Sec.  43.6 each \\nyear. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the total annual \\nburden associated with Sec.  43.6(g)(2) would be approximately 2,250 \\nannual labor hours or $416,025 in annual labor costs.\\\\528\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\528\\\\ The labor hour estimate is calculated as follows: (125 \\nSDs/MSPs x 500 notifications) + (1,000 non-SDs/non-MSPs x 5 \\nnotifications) = 67,500 notifications x 2 minutes/notification = \\n135,000 minutes/60 minutes/hour = 2,250 hours. The labor cost \\nestimate is calculated as follows: 2,250 labor hours x $140.93 per \\nhour total compensation = $317,092. The Commission notes that the \\ncalculation in the Further Block Proposal incorrectly listed the \\nlabor hour estimate as 2,255 hours (rather than 2,250). The labor \\ncost estimate was then incorrectly listed as $317,797 (rather than \\n$317,092) due to the incorrect labor hour estimate.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 32915]]\\n\\n    In addition, the Commission estimates that Sec.  43.6(g)(2) results \\nin $11.8 million in non-recurring annualized capital and start-up \\ncosts.\\\\529\\\\ The Real-Time Reporting Final Rule addressed all ongoing \\noperational and maintenance costs.\\\\530\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\529\\\\ The estimated costs are based on the Commission\\'s estimate \\nof the incremental, non-recurring expenditures to reporting \\nentities, including non-SD/non-MSPs (i.e., non-financial end-users) \\nto (1) update existing technology, including updating its OMS system \\n($6,761.20); and (2) provide training to existing personnel and \\nupdate written policies and procedures ($3,195.00). See section \\nV.D.1. infra. The Commission believes that SDs/MSPs would incur \\nsimilar non-recurring start-up costs. The Commission has previously \\nestimated that 125 SDs and MSPs will register with the Commission \\nand 1,000 non-financial end-users (i.e., non-SD/non-MSPs) will be \\nrequired to report in a year. 77 FR 1229-30.\\n    \\\\530\\\\ See 77 FR at 1232.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Amendments to Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and 43.4(h)\\n    The Commission addresses the public dissemination of certain swaps \\nin the other commodity asset class in Sec.  43.4(d)(4). Section \\n43.4(d)(4)(ii) provides that for publicly reportable swaps in the other \\ncommodity asset class, the actual underlying assets must be publicly \\ndisseminated for: (1) Those swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules \\nof a SEF or DCM; (2) those swaps referencing one of the contracts \\ndescribed in appendix B to part 43; and (3) any publicly reportable \\nswap transaction that is economically related to one of the contracts \\ndescribed in appendix B to part 43. Pursuant to the Real-Time Reporting \\nFinal Rule, any swap that is in the other commodity asset class that \\ndoes not fall under Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) would not be subject to \\nreporting and public dissemination requirements upon the effective date \\nof the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule.\\n    In this final rule, the Commission is promulgating a new provision \\n(Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii)), which would develop a system for the public \\ndissemination of exact underlying assets in the other commodity asset \\nclass with a ``mask\\'\\' based on geographic detail. The Commission is \\nadopting a new appendix to part 43, which contains the geographical \\ntop-codes that SDRs would use in masking certain other commodity swaps \\nin connection with such swaps public dissemination of swap transaction \\nand pricing data under part 43. The Commission anticipates that there \\nwill be approximately 50,000 additional swaps reported to an SDR each \\nyear in the other commodity asset class, which the Commission estimates \\nwould be $154,021 in annualized hour burden costs.\\\\531\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\531\\\\ The Commission estimates that there will be 5 SDRs, which \\nwill collect swaps data in the other commodity asset class. Each SDR \\nwould collect swaps data on approximately 10,000 swap transactions \\nin the other commodity asset class. The commission estimates that it \\nwill take each SDR on average approximately 1 minute to publicly \\ndisseminate swaps data related to these new swap transactions. The \\nnumber of burden hours for these SDRs would be 833 hours. As \\nreferenced in note 523 supra, the total labor costs for a swap \\ntrader is $140.93. Thus, the total number of burden hour costs equal \\nthe total number of burden hours (833 burden hours) x $140.93.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission\\'s regulations currently provide a system \\nestablishing cap sizes. Section 43.4(h) of the Commission\\'s regulations \\nprovides that cap sizes for swaps in each asset class shall equal the \\nappropriate minimum block size corresponding to such publicly \\nreportable swap transaction. If no appropriate minimum block size \\nexists, then Sec.  43.4(h) sets out specific interim cap sizes for each \\nasset class.\\\\532\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\532\\\\ The Real-Time Reporting Final Rule calculated and \\naddressed the total ongoing burden hours and burden hour costs. See \\n77 FR 11232.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    This final rule amends Sec.  43.4(h) to establish new cap sizes in \\nthe post-initial period using a 75-percent notional amount calculation. \\nUnder this amendment, the Commission will perform the calculation; \\nhowever, SDRs will update their technology and other systems at a \\nminimum of once per year to publicly disseminate swap transaction and \\npricing data with the cap sizes issued by the Commission.\\n    The Commission estimates that the incremental start-up costs \\nassociated with the amendment to Sec. Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and 43.4(h) for \\nan SDR would include: (1) Reprograming its technology infrastructure to \\naccommodate the masking system and post-initial cap sizes methodology; \\n(2) updating its written policies and procedures to ensure compliance \\nwith Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) and the amendment to Sec.  43.4(h); and (3) \\ntraining staff on the new policies and procedures.\\\\533\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\533\\\\ The economic costs associated with entering into a third \\nparty service arrangement to transmit an electronic notice to an SDR \\nare difficult to determine because of too many variables involved in \\ndetermining those costs. Notwithstanding this difficulty, the \\nCommission believes that, for many reporting parties that \\ninfrequently trade swaps, the annualized cost of entering into a \\nthird-party service arrangement of this type would likely be less \\nthan the total annual cost of building an electronic infrastructure \\nto transmit electronic notices directly to an SDR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nV.

Due to the clearing \\nmandate, the Final Rule at this time mainly will affect pre-trade \\ntransparency only in the interest rate and credit default asset \\nclasses. In regard to the foreign exchange and other commodity asset \\nclasses, the Commission notes that there is no clearing mandate for \\nforeign exchange swaps and other commodity swaps at this time. Thus, \\nthe swaps block rule does not currently affect pre-trade transparency \\nfor these asset classes. As these markets evolve, the Commission will \\ncontinue to monitor developments within each asset class and may \\nexercise its legal authority to take action by rule or order if \\nnecessary to address changes in the markets.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\561\\\\ The costs and benefits attendant to the time delay and \\ndevelopment of an infrastructure for block trades and large notional \\noff-facility swaps are discussed in Real-Time Public Reporting of \\nSwap Transaction Data, 77 FR 1182, 1232, Jan. 9, 2012.\\n    \\\\562\\\\ See, the Core Principles and Other Requirements for Swap \\nExecution Facilities notice of proposed rulemaking, 76 FR 1214 (Jan. \\n7, 2011).\\n    \\\\563\\\\ The Commission separately proposed rules to determine \\nwhether a swap is ``made available to trade\\'\\' for purposes of the \\ntrade execution requirement in CEA section 2(h)(8). Process for a \\nDesignated Contract Market or Swap Execution Facility To Make a Swap \\nAvailable to Trade, 76 FR 77728 (proposed Dec. 14, 2011).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    This rulemaking requires the Commission to carefully navigate a \\ntension that CEA section 2(a)(13) recognizes: while section 2(a)(13)(C) \\nrequires the Commission to promulgate rules to bring real-time public \\nreporting to the swaps market, section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv) requires that in \\ndoing so\\n\\n[[Page 32917]]\\n\\nthe Commission ``take into account whether the public disclosure will \\nmaterially reduce market liquidity.\\'\\' The Commission has followed both \\ndirectives. Accordingly, a central focus of the Commission\\'s \\nconsideration of costs and benefits of this rulemaking is the interplay \\nbetween the important benefits of enhanced swap transaction \\ntransparency that real-time public dissemination affords \\\\564\\\\ and the \\npotential that, in certain circumstances, transparency could reduce \\nswap market liquidity. As evident by commenters\\' divergent opinions, \\nthe optimal point in this interplay, and how to set it, defies \\nprecision.\\\\565\\\\ Given this fact, these rules reflect the Commission\\'s \\nreasoned judgment of how best to meaningfully effectuate real-time \\npublic reporting of swap transactions--and the transparency Congress \\nintended--in a manner that takes into account the impact on market \\nliquidity. Briefly, the Commission will use a 67% percent notional \\ncalculation to determine the threshold over which block trades and \\nlarge notional off-facility swaps will be eligible for block trade \\ntreatment, meaning that most swaps will be reported in real-time.\\\\566\\\\ \\nAt the same time, a phased implementation schedule assures that \\ntransparency is introduced incrementally, taking into account whether \\npublic disclosure will ``materially reduce market liquidity.\\'\\' For \\nexample, to cushion potential liquidity impact, the thresholds for \\nswaps in the interest rate and credit assets classes will initially \\nrest conservatively at 50 percent, thus allowing transactions above 50 \\npercent of the notional amount to remain shielded from real-time public \\nreporting, before transitioning to 67 percent in the post-initial \\nperiod. While this departure from the proposal means that fewer swaps \\nwill be subject to real-time transparency during the initial period, it \\naffords the Commission the opportunity to collect and analyze data on \\nthe use of block thresholds and to apply that data to its evaluation of \\nthe risks attendant to a less transparent market. Simultaneously \\nintroducing a conservative, 50 percent threshold also allows the \\nCommission to assess whether there are material reductions in the \\nliquidity for some swaps and take any measures to stave off those \\nreductions, as the rules allow the Commission to review and refine the \\nthresholds as liquidity and transparency needs may warrant in the \\nfuture.\\\\567\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\564\\\\ The benefits of public dissemination of swap transaction \\nand pricing data are detailed in Real-Time Public Reporting of Swap \\nTransaction Data, 77 FR at 1234. As the Commission explained in that \\nrelease and reaffirms here, swap transaction reporting and public \\ndissemination benefits market participants and the public in a \\nnumber of respects. Among others discussed in that earlier release, \\nand considered by reference herein, these include enhanced: price \\ndiscovery, ability to manage risk as a result of improved visibility \\ninto swap market risk pricing, and improved swap market price \\ncompetition. Additionally, the transparency afforded through public \\ndissemination of swap transaction and pricing data ``will enhance \\nthe Commission\\'s ability to detect anomalies in the market . . . and \\nprovide a check against a reoccurrence of the type of systemic risk \\nbuild-up that occurred in 2008 when `the market permitted enormous \\nexposure to risk to grow out of the sight of regulators and other \\ntraders [and d]erivatives exposures that could not be readily \\nquantified exacerbated panic and uncertainty about the true \\nfinancial condition of other market participants, contributing to \\nthe freezing of credit markets.\\' \\'\\' Id. (quoting Congressional \\nResearch Service Report for Congress, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \\nReform and Consumer Protection Act: Title VII, Derivatives, by Mark \\nJickling and Kathleen Ann Ruane (August 30, 2010).\\n    \\\\565\\\\ Indeed, CEA section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv), in simply requiring \\nthat the Commission ``take into account whether public disclosure \\nwill materially reduce market liquidity,\\'\\' does not require that the \\nCommission attempt to determine the precise optimal relationship \\nbetween transparency and liquidity or assure no liquidity loss.\\n    \\\\566\\\\ Using the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Supervisors Group \\n(``ODSG\\'\\') data for interest rate swaps, the Commission notes that \\nthe 67 percent notional amount calculation would result in 94 \\npercent of trades being reported in real-time. A discussion of the \\nODSG and the data set is set forth in section II.C.1 of this final \\nrule.\\n    \\\\567\\\\ See Sec.  43.6(f).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nB. The Statutory Mandate To Consider the Costs and Benefits of the \\nCommission\\'s Action: Section 15(a) of the CEA\\n\\n    Section 15(a) of the CEA \\\\568\\\\ requires the Commission to consider \\nthe costs and benefits of its actions before promulgating a regulation \\nunder the CEA or issuing certain orders. Section 15(a) further \\nspecifies that the costs and benefits shall be evaluated in light of \\nthe following five broad areas of market and public concern: (1) \\nProtection of market participants and the public; (2) efficiency, \\ncompetitiveness, and financial integrity of futures markets; (3) price \\ndiscovery; (4) sound risk management practices; and (5) other public \\ninterest considerations. The Commission considers the costs and \\nbenefits resulting from its discretionary determinations with respect \\nto the section 15(a) factors.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\568\\\\ 7 U.S.C. 19(a).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    These amending rules become effective in--and their costs and \\nbenefits are considered relative to--the context of the conditions now \\nin place under part 43. That is: all publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions are currently subject to a time delay and are not publicly \\nreported in real-time.<SUP>569 570</SUP> Unless otherwise indicated, \\nthe Commission has looked to a non-financial end-user that already has \\ndeveloped the technical capability and infrastructure necessary to \\ncomply with the requirements set forth in part 43 as a reference entity \\nfor estimating this rulemaking\\'s direct costs under the assumption that \\nthe costs for this particular market participant would represent the \\nmaximum degree of compliance costs.\\\\571\\\\ The Commission anticipates, \\nhowever, that in many cases the actual costs to established market \\nparticipants (including swap counterparties, SDRs and other registered \\nentities) would be lower than for the reference entity--perhaps \\nsignificantly so, depending on the type, flexibility, and scalability \\nof systems already in place.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\569\\\\ See Sec.  43.5(c).\\n    \\\\570\\\\ Currently, the part 43 requirements are not applicable to \\nswaps in the other commodities asset class that reference underlying \\nassets not included in Appendix B to Part 43. The Real-Time \\nReporting Rule provides notice that, until such time as the \\nanonymity provisions of this final rule are finalized, those off-\\nfacility swaps not listed in appendix B to part 43 are not be \\nrequired to comply with the real-time reporting and public \\ndissemination requirements under part 43. However, such swaps are \\nsubject to the regulatory reporting requirements, described in \\nproposed part 45. According to the BIS report <a href=\"http://bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qs1209.pdf\">http://bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qs1209.pdf</a>, commodities (as a whole and not just the \\nsubset identified above) only represent slightly more than one third \\nof one percent (0.36%) of the notional amounts outstanding as a \\npercentage of the global OTC derivatives market for the end of \\nDecember 2011. For this small subset of other commodity swaps, the \\nstarting point for the purposes of the Commission\\'s consideration of \\nthe costs and benefits is the same as the starting point for the \\nCommission\\'s consideration of costs and benefits of the Real-Time \\nReporting Rule. A detailed discussion of the Commission\\'s \\nconsideration of those costs and benefits is contained in the Real-\\nTime Reporting Rule. See 77 FR at 1232-1240.\\n    \\\\571\\\\ A non-financial end-user is a new market entrant with no \\nprior swaps market participation or infrastructure. This reference \\npoint is different from the reference point(s) used in the PRA \\nanalysis in section V above for the following two reasons: (1) the \\nburdens in the PRA are narrower than the costs discussed in this \\nsection (i.e., the PRA analysis solely discusses costs relating to \\ncollections of information, whereas this cost-benefit analysis \\nconsiders all costs relating to the proposed rules); and (2) as \\ndiscussed above, the cost-benefit analysis determines costs relative \\nto one market participant that presumably would bear the highest \\nburdens in implementing the proposed rules, whereas the PRA analysis \\nseeks to estimate the costs of the proposed rules on all market \\nparticipants.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Wherever reasonably feasible, the Commission has endeavored to \\nquantify the costs and benefits of this rulemaking. In a number of \\ninstances, the Commission lacks the data and information required to \\nprecisely estimate costs, owing to the fact that these markets do not \\nyet exist or are not yet fully developed. The Commission requested that \\ncommenters provide any data or other information that would be useful \\nin the estimation of the\\n\\n[[Page 32918]]\\n\\nquantifiable costs and benefits of this rulemaking \\\\572\\\\; no commenters \\nsupplied such data or other information. Where it was not feasible to \\nquantify (e.g., because of the lack of accurate data or appropriate \\nmetrics), the Commission has considered the costs and benefits of these \\nrules in qualitative terms.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\572\\\\ Further Block Proposal Q93(a)-(e), 77 FR at 15507.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For purposes of considering their costs and benefits, the \\nCommission has organized these rules in three groups: (1) Block trade \\nrules concerning the criteria for determining swap categories and the \\nmethodologies to be used to determine the initial and post-initial \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for large notional off-facility swaps \\nand block trades; (2) block trade rules concerning the method by which \\nswap counterparties may elect to treat a qualifying swap transaction as \\na block trade or a large notional off-facility swap, as applicable, and \\nSEFs and DCMs notify an SDR of a block trade election; and (3) rules \\nconcerning anonymity protections. Each group is discussed below.\\n\\nC. Rules Establishing Determination Criteria and Methodology (Sec.  \\n43.6(a)-(f) and (h))\\n\\n    Rules 43.6(a)-(f) and (h) specify the Commission\\'s criteria for \\nestablishing swap categories and methodology for determining \\nappropriate minimum block sizes. The subsections that follow provide a \\nbrief contextual summary description of the rules; identify and discuss \\nthe costs and benefits attributable to the rules in light of comments; \\nconsider alternatives; and consider costs and benefits relative to \\nfactors specified in CEA section 15(a).\\n1. Rule Summary\\n    Rules 43.6(a)-(f) and (h) are described previously in this \\nrelease.\\\\573\\\\ A summary of each follows:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\573\\\\ See section II, supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\na. Rule 43.6(a) Commission Determination\\n    Rule 43.6(a) provides that the Commission will determine the \\nappropriate minimum block size for any swap on a SEF or DCM, and for \\nlarge notional off-facility swaps. The rule also sets forth a schedule \\nwhereby the Commission will calculate and publish all appropriate \\nminimum block sizes across all asset classes no less than once each \\ncalendar year, following an initial period (as described below).\\nb. Rule 43.6(b) Swap Category\\n    Rule 43.6(b) specifies the Commission\\'s approach for grouping swaps \\nby asset class based on existing liquidity in underlying cash markets, \\nrelevant economic indicators, the underlying asset class, and the \\nCommission\\'s analysis of relevant swap market data supplied to the \\nCommission.\\\\574\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\574\\\\ Data was supplied to the Commission by MarkitSERV and The \\nWarehouse Trust Company LLC. The data is more fully described in \\nSection II.A.1.a. of this release.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nc. Rules 43.6(c)-(f) and (h) Methods for Determining Appropriate \\nMinimum Block Sizes\\n    Rules 43.6(c)-(f) and (h) prescribe a phased-in approach, with an \\ninitial period and a post-initial period for determining appropriate \\nminimum block sizes for each swap category. Appendix F to part 43 \\ncontains a schedule of appropriate minimum block sizes effective during \\nthe initial period. The schedule reflects a different appropriate \\nminimum block size methodology for the interest rate and credit asset \\nclasses than for the equity, FX and other commodity asset classes. The \\ninitial appropriate minimum block sizes for the interest rate and \\ncredit asset class are derived from data supplied by the ODSG.\\\\575\\\\ As \\nset forth in Appendix F to this Final Rule, the Commission is \\ncalculating the appropriate minimum block sizes in interest rate and \\ncredit asset classes based upon the 50-percent notional amount \\ncalculation set forth in Sec.  43.6(c)(1) in the initial period.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\575\\\\ A discussion of the ODSG and the data set is set forth in \\nsection II.C.1 of this final rule.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Rule 43.6(d) states that swaps in the equity asset class shall not \\nbe treated as block trades or large notional off-facility swaps (i.e., \\nequity swaps would not be subject to a time delay as provided in part \\n43).\\n    With respect to the FX and other commodity asset classes, the \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for swaps during the initial period is \\ndivided primarily between swaps that are futures-related swaps and \\nthose that are not futures-related.\\\\576\\\\ Appendix F to part 43 lists \\nthe proposed initial appropriate minimum block sizes for swap \\ncategories in the FX and other commodity asset classes. For swaps in \\nthe FX and other commodity asset classes that are not listed in \\nappendix F to part 43, Sec.  43.6(e)(2) generally provides that these \\nswaps will be considered block trades or large notional off-facility \\nswaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\576\\\\ As explained above in section II.C., the Commission \\nbelieves that the difference in methodology for determining initial \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for swaps in the FX and other \\ncommodity asset classes is warranted because: (1) Swaps in these \\nasset classes are closely linked to futures markets; and (2) DCMs \\nhave experience in setting block sizes for futures.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After an SDR has collected reliable data for a particular asset \\nclass, Sec.  43.6(f)(1) provides that the Commission shall determine \\npost-initial appropriate minimum block sizes for all swaps in the \\ninterest rate, credit, FX and other commodity asset classes based on \\nthe 67-percent notional amount calculation. The Commission is also \\nadopting special rules for the determination of appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes that would apply to all asset classes, including rules \\napplicable to swaps with optionality, swaps with composite reference \\nprices, physical commodity swaps, currency conversion, and successor \\ncurrencies.\\\\577\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\577\\\\ See proposed rule Sec.  43.6(h).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Overview of Comments Received\\n    The Commission received numerous comments regarding the potential \\ncosts and benefits to market participants and the public in response to \\nthe rules establishing the criteria and methodology for determining \\nblock thresholds. Commenters were divided on whether the Commission \\nproperly considered costs or misstated or ignored the benefits of the \\nrules. Some commenters touched on the cost benefit considerations \\ndirectly by promoting various alternatives to the proposed rules.\\\\578\\\\ \\nComments relating to the Commission\\'s consideration of costs and \\nbenefits are discussed specifically in the sections below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\578\\\\ E.g., CL-AII at 6; CL-SIFMA at 10; CL-WMBAA at 8; CL-CME \\nat 2; CL-Vanguard at 3; CL-Morgan Stanley at 3; CL-ICAP Energy at 3; \\nCL-Barnard at 1; CL-Freddie at 2; CL-Barclays at 10.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Costs\\na. Direct Costs\\n    Rules 43.6(a)-(f) and (h) will impose recurring costs on swap \\nmarket participants and registered entities (i.e., SEFs, DCMs, or SDRs) \\nto accommodate the Commission\\'s publication of post-initial appropriate \\nminimum block sizes at least once each calendar year following the \\ninitial period. In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission \\nanticipated that in order for registered entities to comply with the \\nrule, they would need to update their existing data systems and that \\nprocess would entail approximately 40 initial, non-recurring personnel \\nhours at an approximate cost of $2,728 for each registered entity.\\\\579\\\\ \\nThis estimate included the potential number of burden hours required to\\n\\n[[Page 32919]]\\n\\nmake a one-time adjustment to internal procedures, reprogram systems \\nand implement processes to segregate the data by swap categories and \\nincorporate data on appropriate minimum block sizes as published by the \\nCommission at least once each calendar year.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\579\\\\ The estimate is calculated as follows: (Senior Programmer \\nat 20 hours) + (Systems Analyst at 20 hours). A senior programmer\\'s \\nadjusted hourly wage is $81.52. A systems analyst\\'s adjusted hourly \\nwage is $54.89. See note 521 supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Market participants other than registered entities, and \\nspecifically non-financial end users, expectedly will need to train \\ntheir existing personnel and update their written policies and \\nprocedures to comply with Sec.  43.6(a)-(f) and (h). The Commission \\nestimated that the training and updating of policies and procedures \\nwill impose an initial non-recurring burden of approximately 15 \\npersonnel hours at an approximate cost of $1,430 for each non-financial \\nend-user.\\\\580\\\\ This cost estimate included the number of potential \\nburden hours required to produce and design training materials, conduct \\ntraining with existing personnel, and revise and circulate written \\npolicies and procedures in compliance with the proposed requirements.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\580\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Compliance \\nManager at 10 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 3 hours) + \\n(Compliance Attorney at 2 hours) = 15 hours per non-financial end-\\nuser who is a reporting party. A compliance manager\\'s adjusted \\nhourly wage is $77.77. A director of compliance\\'s hourly wage is \\n$158.21. A compliance attorney\\'s hourly wage is $89.43. See note 521 \\nsupra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received one comment specifically addressing direct \\ncosts. WMBAA disagreed with the Further Block Proposal\\'s projected cost \\nestimates and contended that the Commission\\'s approach ``is overly \\nsimplistic and does not contemplate the actual efforts a SEF will have \\nto undertake to implement the block trade regime, including the two-\\nstep notification process, the technology upgrades, providing training \\nto existing personnel and updating written policies and procedures, \\namong other necessary actions to comply with the CFTC\\'s proposed \\nrule.\\'\\' \\\\581\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\581\\\\ CL-WMBAA at 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Because WMBAA did not provide data to support or monetize its cost \\nconcern, the Commission has considered them qualitatively. Further, \\nWMBAA\\'s disagreement with the Further Block Proposal\\'s cost estimates \\ndoes not concern the incremental cost to augment and maintain systems \\nand processes that the Commission believes entities need have in place \\nto comply with the real time reporting requirement of Section 2(a)(13) \\nof the CEA; rather it concerns the cost to comply with that statutory \\nrequirement as prescribed by the existing part 43 implementation \\nregulations. SEFs and DCMs would incur these costs regardless of how \\nthe Commission determines block thresholds. Accordingly, the Commission \\nconsiders WMBAA\\'s criticism of the cost estimates in this rulemaking \\nmisplaced. Moreover, the Commission has intentionally structured the \\nrequirements of Sec.  43.6(a) to mitigate these costs; this rule\\'s \\napproach seeks to leverage the existing connectivity, infrastructure \\nand arrangements that market participants and registered entities will \\nhave already established to comply with the part 43 regulations.\\n    The Commission did not find, nor was it provided, additional \\ninformation that was sufficient to change the cost basis. Therefore, \\nthe Commission is maintaining the Further Block Proposal\\'s approach to \\ncalculating the direct costs resulting from the methodology for \\ndetermining block thresholds. However, the Commission is revising its \\nestimates to reflect wage rate data updated since the Further Block \\nProposal was published. The Commission estimates that for registered \\nentities to update existing technology as necessary will entail \\napproximately 40 initial, non-recurring personnel hours at an \\napproximate cost of $2,874 for each registered entity.\\\\582\\\\ The \\nCommission estimates that training for existing personnel and updating \\nwritten policies and procedures will impose an initial non-recurring \\nburden of approximately 15 personnel hours at an approximate cost of \\n$1,456 for each non-financial end-user.\\\\583\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\582\\\\ The estimate is calculated as follows: (Senior Programmer \\nat 20 hours) + (Systems Analyst at 20 hours). A senior programmer\\'s \\nadjusted hourly wage is $86.89. A systems analyst\\'s adjusted hourly \\nwage is $56.79. See note 521 supra.\\n    \\\\583\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Compliance \\nManager at 10 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 3 hours) + \\n(Compliance Attorney at 2 hours) = 15 hours per non-financial end-\\nuser who is a reporting party. A compliance manager\\'s adjusted \\nhourly wage is $74.17. A director of compliance\\'s hourly wage is \\n$169.16. A compliance attorney\\'s hourly wage is $103.18. See note \\n521 supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb. Indirect Costs\\n    The Commission received numerous comments regarding indirect costs \\nthat could result from the establishment of criteria and methodology \\nfor setting appropriate minimum block thresholds. The majority of these \\ncomments focused on the issue of market liquidity; and many of the \\ncomments provided alternatives for either lower notional amount \\ncalculation thresholds, and extended phase-in or restricting the asset \\nclasses to which thresholds would apply. Eleven commenters suggested \\nthat the 67 percent notional amount calculation set forth in proposed \\nSec.  43.6(c)(1) would have a negative impact on market liquidity.\\\\584\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\584\\\\ CL-AII at 6; CL-SIFMA at 10; CL-WMBAA at 8; CL-CME at 2; \\nCL-Vanguard at 3; CL-Morgan Stanley at 3; CL-ICAP Energy at 3; CL-\\nBarnard at 1; CL-Freddie at 2; CL-Barclays at 10.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    SIFMA and AII asserted that the 67 percent notional amount \\ncalculation is under inclusive for most swap categories and that the \\nCommission should start with low block sizes (or classify all swaps as \\nblock trades) until data can be accumulated.\\\\585\\\\ Consequences of a \\nhigh threshold, they maintain, would be reduced liquidity, \\nfragmentation of trading, higher transaction costs and higher swap \\npricing costs to end users.\\\\586\\\\ AII stated that high block sizes would \\npermit front running of swap dealers\\' hedging activities.\\\\587\\\\ SIFMA \\nsuggested that the Commission identify minimum liquidity thresholds for \\ncertain swaps in each swap category below which all swaps should be \\ntreated as blocks.\\\\588\\\\ SIFMA stated that 67 percent is too high to \\nprevent liquidity impact; that 20-33 percent of trades should be \\nblocks; and that 50 percent is better than 67 percent.\\\\589\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\585\\\\ CL-AII at 6; CL-SIFMA at 10.\\n    \\\\586\\\\ CL-AII at 6; CL-SIFMA at 10.\\n    \\\\587\\\\ CL-AII at 6.\\n    \\\\588\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 10.\\n    \\\\589\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 10.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    WMBAA advocated using a 50 percent or lower block level and that \\nthe Commission rely on more timely and complete data to avoid impairing \\nliquidity.\\\\590\\\\ CME asserted that 67 percent is arbitrary, has no \\nrelationship to the explicit goals of Dodd-Frank with respect to block \\ntrading of swaps, and would materially reduce market liquidity.\\\\591\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\590\\\\ CL-WMBAA at 8.\\n    \\\\591\\\\ CL-CME at 2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Vanguard commented that block rules bringing transparency may \\nultimately increase liquidity, but an abrupt change could decrease \\nliquidity.\\\\592\\\\ Vanguard instead favored a lower, 25 percent initial \\nnotional calculation methodology or perhaps providing block treatment \\nto all swaps for one-year before phasing in notional amount calculation \\nthresholds, maintaining that a lack of data compromises the setting of \\nblocks and risks a negative liquidity impact.\\\\593\\\\ Vanguard further \\nurged more swap category granularity by identifying discrete \\n``liquidity pools\\'\\', and asserted that the lack of a sufficient time \\ndelay would hamper liquidity providers\\' ability to enter into off-\\nsetting trades.\\\\594\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\592\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 3.\\n    \\\\593\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 3.\\n    \\\\594\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 3.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 32920]]\\n\\n    Morgan Stanley, AII, and CME all stated that the approach in the \\nFurther Block Proposal would sacrifice liquidity in the name of \\ntransparency in contravention of the statute.\\\\595\\\\ Specifically, Morgan \\nStanley commented that the proposed rules would diminish liquidity \\nbecause the market would know details of transactions that are about to \\ntake place; Morgan Stanley also provided examples of IRS swaps under \\nthe proposed threshold that might move the market and, without \\nproviding further support, stated that application of the 67 percent \\nnotional amount calculation in CDS would result in too few trades \\nreceiving treatment as blocks and reduce liquidity.\\\\596\\\\ Morgan Stanley \\nurged the Commission to lower block thresholds and apply them only to \\nvanilla structures with standard maturities; Morgan Stanley further \\nadvocated for DCM/SEFs to set block sizes because they would maximize \\nliquidity.\\\\597\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\595\\\\ CL-Morgan Stanley at 3; CL-AII at 6; CL-CME at 2.\\n    \\\\596\\\\ CL-Morgan Stanley at 3.\\n    \\\\597\\\\ CL-Morgan Stanley at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ICAP and Barnard asserted that the Further Block Proposal fails to \\nevaluate the effect of the block thresholds on liquidity.\\\\598\\\\ ICAP \\nstated that the Commission misconstrued the legislative intent of Dodd-\\nFrank Act because the Further Block Proposal 1) proposes a ``results-\\noriented\\'\\' approach; 2) does not determine if the 67 percent \\nmethodology would minimize impact on market liquidity; and 3) \\nestablishes block size thresholds based on notional size rather than \\nnumber of transactions.\\\\599\\\\ In addition, ICAP stated that the Further \\nBlock Proposal failed to identify a ``market moving\\'\\' transaction for \\ncertain swaps, as intended by Congress and does not propose a \\nmethodology.\\\\600\\\\ Freddie stated that, in the absence of data, minimum \\nblock sizes for Interest Rate swaps are too high and will materially \\nreduce market liquidity.\\\\601\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\598\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 3; CL-Barnard at 1.\\n    \\\\599\\\\ CL-ICAP Energy at 3.\\n    \\\\600\\\\ CL-ICAP at Energy at 3.\\n    \\\\601\\\\ CL-Freddie at 2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission also received comments raising potential indirect \\ncosts besides market liquidity impact. Barclays stated that mandatory \\nclearing and uncleared margin requirements may compound the costs of \\nincreased transparency created by high block trade thresholds.\\\\602\\\\ \\nSIFMA stated that the Commission\\'s cost-benefit consideration is \\ninsufficient and incorrect in the context of mandatory execution under \\nthe proposed SEF rules.\\\\603\\\\ SIFMA expressed the concern that \\n``liquidity seekers\\' [sic] could provide other market participants with \\nthe information needed to front run the successful dealer in the hedge \\nmarket.\\'\\' \\\\604\\\\ SIFMA concluded that ``the Commission should implement \\nlower block trade size thresholds to avoid significant decreases in \\nliquidity or increases in bid-ask spreads.\\'\\' \\\\605\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\602\\\\ CL-Barclays at 10.\\n    \\\\603\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 4.\\n    \\\\604\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 4.\\n    \\\\605\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters objected to the Commission\\'s use of data in the \\nFurther Block Proposal. Five commenters \\\\606\\\\ asserted that the Further \\nBlock Proposal fails to adequately consider costs and benefits and \\nrelies upon obsolete data. AII \\\\607\\\\ stated that the Commission relies \\nupon inadequate and outdated data, that the rules will impede \\ncompetition and increase costs, and that the Commission should look to \\nTRACE as a model for more deliberate disclosure implementation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\606\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 3; CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 11-13; CL-SIFMA at 10; \\nCL-WMBAA at 8; and CL-AII at 6.\\n    \\\\607\\\\ CL-AII at 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Vanguard \\\\608\\\\ suggested phasing in the requirements because the \\nnew rules are a ``paradigm shift,\\'\\' and issuing final rules on block \\ntrades requires more data collection before implementation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\608\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters suggest the Commission collect more and better \\ndata before setting block levels. They criticize not only the dearth of \\nrelevant data but how the Commission has interpolated the data through \\ntrimming mechanism. SIFMA suggests that all swaps should be treated as \\nblocks for first year of compliance during which data is collected, \\nthen the Commission should take a conservative approach to establish \\nand iteratively modify thresholds based on liquidity and bid-ask spread \\nof swaps that near the established block size threshold.\\\\609\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\609\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission also received comments suggesting costs in terms of \\nmarket liquidity or other factors in setting the appropriate minimum \\nblock thresholds too low (or benefits in setting the appropriate \\nminimum block thresholds at 67 percent of notional or higher). \\nConversely, four commenters expressed support for the Further Block \\nProposal\\'s 67 percent notional amount calculation methodology or \\nsuggested that a lower threshold would result in a decrease in \\nliquidity.\\\\610\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\610\\\\ CL-ODEX at 2; CL-SDMA at 3-6; CL-Javelin at 4-6; CL-Arbor \\nat 1.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Specifically, Javelin stated that the Commission should set a \\nhigher block threshold than the 67 percent notional amount calculation \\n``where the market is protected from disruption and where greater \\ntransparency, competition and liquidity are ensured.\\'\\' \\\\611\\\\ SDMA \\ncommented that ``[t]oo low a block threshold and fewer trades will be \\nexecuted on SEFs as little structural change in swaps execution occurs, \\nincreased competition fails to manifest itself and more diverse \\nliquidity is impaired.\\'\\' \\\\612\\\\ AFR asserted that some drop in liquidity \\nwas assumed by Congress when it enacted the provision and that ``there \\nis no authoritative study supporting the concept that immediate \\ndisclosure would distort prices because of market liquidity.\\'\\' \\\\613\\\\ \\nSimilarly, Better Markets argued that any information embargo should be \\neliminated, stating that ``there is no authoritative study validating \\nthe notion that market liquidity would be adversely affected if Block \\nTrade data were fully disclosed.\\'\\' \\\\614\\\\ Better Markets also stated \\nthat the public benefits of swap data transparency under the Further \\nBlock Proposal greatly outweigh the private costs to the disclosing \\nentities and to the swaps market participants; Better Markets argued \\nthat Congress\\' ultimate objective in the Dodd-Frank Act was to prevent \\nanother crisis and avert the massive costs it would inflict upon the \\npublic (including all market participants), and that the consideration \\nof costs and benefits should focus on this overriding public \\ninterest.\\\\615\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\611\\\\ CL-Javelin at 2.\\n    \\\\612\\\\ CL-SDMA at 1.\\n    \\\\613\\\\ CL-AFR at 4.\\n    \\\\614\\\\ CL-Better Markets at 4.\\n    \\\\615\\\\ CL-Better Markets at 4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In response to comments advocating for a more gradual phase in of \\nappropriate minimum block thresholds, the Commission is adopting rules \\nestablishing a more conservative 50 percent notional amount calculation \\nfor determining block thresholds in the Interest Rate Swap and Credit \\nDefault Swap categories during the initial period. This will allow for \\na more gradual phase-in of the 67 percent notional amount calculation \\nfor determining block thresholds in the post-initial period than what \\nwas proposed. The block trade methodology that will be implemented by \\nthe Commission also allows minimum appropriate block trade amounts to \\nchange periodically in response to the new data collected in the \\nmarket.\\n    The Commission believes that this implements the congressional \\ndirective\\n\\n[[Page 32921]]\\n\\nfor transparency while accounting for possible material reductions in \\nliquidity through the phasing-in of real-time reporting of a portion of \\nthe swaps market. In contrast, SIFMA\\'s suggestion of treating all swaps \\nas blocks while the Commission collects data inverts the public policy \\nrationale underlying congressional requirements for transparency \\nthrough real-time public reporting. The most useful data for \\ndetermining at what levels blocks would be appropriate is data \\ncollected for swaps reported in real-time when market participants have \\nthe ability to execute block trades above minimum block thresholds. \\nData collected prior to the point where real-time reporting and block \\nlevels are functioning together is useful (and has been used by the \\nCommission in fashioning block thresholds in the initial period for \\nswaps in the interest rate and credit asset classes), but provides an \\nincomplete picture absent implementation of the real-time reporting \\nregime. The Commission\\'s 67 percent notional amount calculation in the \\npost-initial period is designed to adjust appropriate minimum block \\nlevels once this data becomes available.\\n    Notwithstanding the fact that the commenters did not provide data \\nto support or monetize their cost concerns, the Commission has \\nconsidered their qualitative comments regarding the potential costs \\nthat the Commission\\'s appropriate minimum block threshold methodology \\nmay have on market liquidity.\\n    The Commission agrees with Vanguard that transparency ultimately \\npromotes increased market liquidity. Transparency afforded through the \\npublication of swap transaction and pricing data is likely to attract \\nmore market participants to the market place, thereby increasing market \\nliquidity depth. However, the Commission also understands the tension \\nbetween achieving greater swap transaction transparency and liquidity: \\nrequired reporting of large transactions without a time delay (i.e., as \\nsoon as technologically practicable) presents potential for downside \\ncost to certain market participants, most particularly market makers \\nproviding liquidity. The immediate reporting of swaps that approach, \\nbut fall shy of the appropriate minimum block size threshold, may in \\ncertain circumstances increase the difficulty, and thus cost, for \\nliquidity providers to lay off attendant price risks in the market. As \\nthe commenters suggest, market makers ultimately could pass these costs \\non to their end-user clients.\\n    Recognizing the potential for such indirect costs, the Commission \\nbelieves it has designed the criteria and methodology outlined in the \\nrule in a manner that strikes an appropriate balance between the \\nimportance of price discovery and transparency, and concerns about \\npotential costs to market participants. By establishing a 67 percent \\nnotional amount calculation for appropriate minimum block thresholds in \\nthe post initial period, the Commission will bring transparency through \\nreal-time reporting to the vast majority of transactions in the swap \\nmarket.\\n    The Commission believes that the phase-in approach provides swap \\nmarket participants with adequate time to incrementally adjust their \\ntrading practices, technology infrastructure and business arrangements \\nto comply with the new block trade regime. As a result, the rule\\'s \\napproach promotes liquidity since the Commission believes that a \\ntransparent market with improved pre-trade price transparency is likely \\nto attract customers. The Commission expects that indirect costs \\ndescribed above will be mitigated through improved price discovery and \\na decrease in the cost of hedging practices for end users due to \\nimproved transparency and competition in the marketplace.\\n    The Commission also considered the potential that different swaps \\nand futures block criteria and methodology might competitively \\ndisadvantage SEFs to the extent certain market participants consider \\nswaps and futures products competitive substitutes; thus, in turn, \\nfrustrating public interests that Congress, in authorizing SEFs in the \\nDodd-Frank Act, intended to further. For several reasons, the \\nCommission does not believe this will occur. First, as discussed in the \\nSEF Rulemaking, the Commission has provided SEFs with various \\nfunctionalities designed to provide flexibility that will promote the \\ntrading of swaps on SEFs.\\\\616\\\\ Second, by using futures block \\nthresholds as a reference for initially setting the criteria for \\neconomically related swaps, the rule, at a minimum, substantially \\nmitigates any such theoretical costs. Further, the Commission has, and \\nwill use, corrective tools if experience in these newly-regulated \\nmarkets indicates potential for differences in swaps and futures block \\ncriteria and methodology to harm market users through hindered product \\ncompetition. These tools include periodical recalibration of swap \\ncriteria as anticipated under this rule as well as the Commission\\'s \\nability to exercise its legal authority to take action by rule or order \\nto mitigate any potential harm due to hindered competition.\\\\617\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\616\\\\ See, the Core Principles and Other Requirements for Swap \\nExecution Facilities notice of proposed rulemaking, 76 FR 1214 (Jan. \\n7, 2011), for details of functionalities that provide flexibility to \\npromote trading of swaps on SEFs.\\n    \\\\617\\\\ Historically (and under a rule proposed in a pending \\nrulemaking concerning Core Principle 9 for Designated Contract \\nMarkets (``DCMs\\'\\')), DCMs have discretion to set minimum block \\nthresholds for futures trading, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the CEA \\nto require that the Commission specify criteria to determine swap \\nblock trades without imposing an equivalent requirement for \\nCommission specification of futures block criteria. See Core \\nPrinciples and Other Requirements for Designated Contract Markets, \\n75 FR 80572, 80616-17 (Dec. 22, 2010) (Notice of Proposed \\nRulemaking; proposed Sec.  38.503(a) would require that a board of \\ntrade that permits block trade transactions on futures contracts \\nhave rules governing such transactions, including rules limiting \\nblock trades to large transactions and imposing minimum size \\nrequirements, and that block trade size be certified or approved by \\nthe Commission); Core Principles and Other Requirements for \\nDesignated Contract Markets, 77 FR 36612, 36643 (Final Rule; \\nannounces Commission intent to take additional time to consider the \\nproposed rules for block transactions and other aspects of proposed \\nrules under Core Principle 9).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n4. Benefits\\n    The Commission believes that Sec.  43.6(a)-(f) and (h) will \\ngenerate several overarching benefits to swap market participants, \\nregistered entities and the general public. Most notably, the \\nCommission expects that the criteria and methodologies for setting \\nappropriate minimum block sizes will provide greater price transparency \\nfor a substantial portion of swap transactions in a manner carefully \\ncalibrated to preserve and promote swaps market liquidity. More \\nspecifically, the regulations will provide price transparency by \\nlifting the current part 43 real-time reporting time delay \\\\618\\\\ in a \\nmeasured manner for swap transactions with notional values under \\nspecified threshold levels.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\618\\\\ See 77 FR 1240.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    At the same time, the Commission\\'s criteria and methodology--\\nincluding carefully crafted block trade and large-notional off-facility \\nswap categories--are designed to retain time-delay status for those \\nhigh-notional-value transactions, where doing otherwise could \\nnegatively impact market liquidity. In addition to avoiding potential \\nnegative market liquidity impact associated with transactions that \\nremain eligible for a reporting time-delay, the Commission also expects \\nthe liquidity in the market to increase since a more transparent market \\nis likely to attract more customers. The Commission expects improved \\ntransparency and liquidity to have a positive effect on the prices \\nmarket participants will pay for their swaps as\\n\\n[[Page 32922]]\\n\\nwell as to cause a decrease in the cost of hedging due to improved \\ntransparency and competition in the market. The Commission also expects \\nthat lower hedging costs and improved transparency will reduce systemic \\nrisk potential. A swaps market that is transparent to regulators and \\nthe public in real-time, without the interim delays for all \\ntransactions imposed in Part 43, provides for a system that will assist \\nthe Commission\\'s oversight ability. Finally, the Commission believes \\nthat this added transparency will ultimately strengthen the swaps \\nmarket by affording academics, the media, public and market \\nparticipants the opportunity to monitor, study, and analyze these \\npreviously opaque segments of the economy.\\n    The rules\\' phased-in implementation will introduce greater \\ntransparency in an incremental, measured and flexible manner so that \\nappropriate minimum block sizes can respond to changing markets. \\nSection 43.6(f)(2) permits the Commission to set appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes no less than once annually during the post-initial period. \\nIf swap market conditions were to change significantly after the \\nimplementation of the provisions of this final rule, there is nothing \\nthat prevents the Commission from reacting to take action further \\nimproving price transparency or mitigating adverse effects on market \\nliquidity. In an effort to add more flexibility to respond to \\ncontinuing swaps market evolution, the methodology in Sec.  43.6(c)-(f) \\nand (h) will recalibrate appropriate minimum block sizes regularly to \\nensure that those sizes remain appropriate for, and responsive to, \\nthese changing markets.\\n5. Alternatives\\n    The Commission considered alternatives to the determination \\ncriteria and methodology adopted in this rulemaking. The chief \\nalternatives raised by commenters or otherwise considered by the \\nCommission concerned three topics--Commission\\'s determination of \\nminimum block sizes, swap categories, and block methodology--as \\ndiscussed below.\\na. Commission Determination of Minimum Block Sizes\\n    Under Sec.  43.6(a) the Commission will determine minimum block \\nsizes; this approach limits the direct burden on market participants \\nand registered entities relative to an alternative that would require \\nthem to engage a quantitative analysis to ascertain appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes for themselves. Such an alternative approach is \\ninconsistent with the statutory requirement of CEA section \\n2(a)(13)(E)(ii) that the Commission ``specify the criteria for \\ndetermining what constitutes a large notional swap transaction (block \\ntrade) for particular markets and contracts.\\'\\' \\\\619\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\619\\\\ See also 111 Cong. Rec. S. 5921 (daily ed., July 15, 2010) \\n(Statement of Sen Lincoln) (the regulators are given authority to \\nestablish what constitutes a `block trade\\' or `large notional\\' swap \\ntransaction for particular contracts as well as appropriate time \\ndelay in reporting transactions to the public\\'\\').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb. Swap Category Alternatives\\n    Commenters \\\\620\\\\ noted what they described as a lack of granularity \\nin the Commission\\'s choice of swaps categories, which they cautioned \\nwould result in the grouping of liquid swaps together with illiquid \\nswaps in the same swap category. Vanguard \\\\621\\\\ suggested a more \\ngranular approach to setting swap categories and block sizes according \\nto ``distinct liquidity pools.\\'\\' ISDA/SIFMA \\\\622\\\\ suggested subjecting \\na swap to block thresholds as long as the swap has sufficient trading \\nfrequency and trades in such volume that allows full hedging in a short \\nperiod of time and also prevents widening of the spread as a result of \\npublic reporting. In support of such a test, the comment cited research \\nand data to suggest that disclosure does not necessarily lead to \\nincreased transparency and swaps with varying levels of liquidity will \\nbe subject to the same block size. Many commenters expressed that the \\nCommission\\'s determination of swap categories would result in block \\nlevels that are insufficiently granular to account for differences \\nbetween swap asset classes and within swap categories, including the \\ndifferences in transaction frequency and volume.\\\\623\\\\ Some commenters \\nsuggested that all infrequently traded swaps, under a specified level, \\nshould be treated as block trades.\\\\624\\\\ The various swap category \\nalternatives suggested by commenters are more fully discussed and \\nconsidered in Sections II.A.1-5 of this final rule.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\620\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 7; CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 14; CL-SIFMA at 10; and \\nCL-Better Markets at 4.\\n    \\\\621\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n    \\\\622\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 14; and CL-SIFMA at 10.\\n    \\\\623\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 14; CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n    \\\\624\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 14.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that its approach of establishing specific \\ncriteria for grouping swaps into a finite set of defined swap \\ncategories is preferable to the alternatives noted; it provides (1) \\nappropriate granularity that mitigates the potential for like risks to \\ntrade differently; and (2) a clear organizational framework that avoids \\nadministrative burdens for market participants that otherwise could \\narise from more numerous and/or non-uniform swap categories. The \\nCommission made use of swaps market data, as well as market convention, \\nin making its determination of how best to form swap categories and \\nasset classes as well as buckets within each asset class. Ultimately, \\nthe Commission determined that that the best approach was to allow for \\nproducts with similar characteristics and risk structures to be grouped \\ntogether, given that in certain circumstances market participants view \\nsimilar financial products as close substitutes and use them as such \\nfor risk mitigating purposes. The Commission has fashioned its swaps \\ncategories to, where possible, group together swaps that could be used \\nto hedge the same risk or otherwise establish an equivalent position.\\n    Grouping economically-substitutable swaps together makes the \\nsetting of appropriate minimum block sizes on an individual product \\nbasis unnecessary and potentially dangerous in that it would allow for \\nlike risks to trade differently.\\nc. Block Methodology Alternatives\\n    The Commission also considered various alternatives to its proposed \\nmethodologies for determining appropriate minimum block thresholds in \\nboth the initial and the post initial periods. As discussed more fully \\nin Section II.B., the Commission received various comments suggesting \\nalternatives to the phased-in approach contained in the Further Block \\nProposal. Many commenters compared the 67 percent notional amount \\ncalculation to a 50 percent notional amount calculation, as \\nspecifically requested by the Commission in Question 33 of the Further \\nBlock Proposal. Twelve commenters preferred the 67 percent notional \\namount calculation to a 50 percent notional amount calculation; \\nwhereas, nine commenters preferred the 50 percent notional amount \\ncalculation to the 67 percent notional amount calculation. ODEX, RJ \\nO\\'Brien, and Spring Trading expressed support for the 67 percent \\nnotional amount calculation, but also suggested that a higher notional \\namount calculation would be preferable, particularly in the post-\\ninitial period.\\\\625\\\\ AFR, Better Markets, Javelin, and SDMA all \\nrecommended a 75 percent or higher notional amount calculation and a \\nmarket depth and market breadth test.\\\\626\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\625\\\\ CL-ODEX at 1;

(step 2) calculate \\nthe total executed notional volumes for each swap contract in the \\nset from step 1 and calculate the sum total for the swap category \\nover the look back period of one year; (step 3) collect a market \\ndepth snapshot of all of the bids and offers once each minute for \\nthe pre-trade price transparency set of contracts identified in step \\n1; (step 4) identify the four 30-minute periods that contain the \\nhighest amount of executed notional volume each day for each \\ncontract of the pre-trade price transparency set identified in step \\n1 and retain 120 observations related to each 30-minute period for \\neach day of the look-back period; (step 5) determine the average \\nbid-ask spread over the look-back period of one year by averaging \\nthe spreads observed between the largest bid and executed offer for \\nall the observations identified in step 3; (step 6) for each of the \\n120 observations retained in step 4, calculate the sum of the \\nnotional amount of all orders collected from step 3 that fall within \\na range, calculate the average of all of these observations for the \\nlook-back period and divide by two; (step 7) to determine the \\ntrimmed market depth, calculate the sum of the market depth \\ndetermined in step 6 for all swap contracts within a swap category; \\n(step 8) to determine the average trimmed market depth, use the \\nexecuted notional volumes determined in step 2 and calculate a \\nnotional volume weighted average of the notional amounts determined \\nin step 6; (step 9) using the calculations in steps 7 and 8, \\ncalculate the market breadth based on the following formula: market \\nbreadth = averaged trimmed market depth + (trimmed market depth - \\naverage trimmed market depth) x .75;

This approach provides for a more gradual phase-\\nin of minimum block sizes, as recommended by numerous commenters. The \\nCommission believes that the phase-in approach should provide swap \\nmarket participants with an adequate amount of time to incrementally \\nadjust their trading practices, technology infrastructure and business \\narrangements to comply with the new block trade regime.\\n    For the post-initial period, the Commission is adopting Sec.  \\n43.6(f)(1) as proposed. The 67-percent notional amount calculation \\nmeans that, within a swap category, approximately two-thirds of the sum \\ntotal of all notional amounts will be reported on a real-time basis. \\nThis approach will afford market participants a timely view of a \\nsubstantial portion of swap transaction and pricing data to assist them \\nin determining the competitive price for swaps within a relevant swap \\ncategory. The Commission anticipates that this enhanced price \\ntransparency will encourage market participants to provide liquidity \\n(e.g., through the posting of bids and offers), particularly when \\ntransaction prices move away from the competitive price. The Commission \\nalso anticipates that enhanced price transparency thereby will improve \\nmarket integrity and price discovery, while also reducing information \\nasymmetries enjoyed by market makers in predominately opaque swap \\nmarkets.\\\\639\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\639\\\\ The proposed calculation stands in contrast to another \\nalternative--the proposed 95th percentile-based distribution test \\nset out in the Initial Proposal. See the discussion in section I.B. \\nof the Further Block Proposal. No commenters suggested or supported \\nthe distribution test in response to the Further Block Proposal.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the Commission\\'s view, using the 67-percent notional amount \\ncalculation also would minimize the potential impact of real-time \\npublic reporting on liquidity risk compared to other alternatives. The \\n67 percent notional amount calculation represents a middle ground \\nbetween the many commenters who supported higher block thresholds and \\nthe many commenters who preferred much more conservative thresholds. \\nThe Commission believes that its methodology, in conjunction with the \\n50-percent notional amount calculation during the initial period, \\nrepresents a tailored and incremental approach for achieving the goal \\nof ``a vast majority\\'\\' of swap transactions becoming subject to real-\\ntime public reporting.\\\\640\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\640\\\\ The ``guiding principle in setting appropriate block trade \\nlevels [is that] the vast majority of swap transactions should be \\nexposed to the public market through exchange trading.\\'\\' \\nCongressional Record--Senate, S5902, S5922 (July 15, 2010). As \\ndiscussed above, this phased-in approach seeks to improve \\ntransparency while not having a negative impact on market liquidity.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As noted above, CEA section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv) directs the Commission \\nto take into account whether the public disclosure of swap transaction \\nand pricing data ``will materially reduce market liquidity.\\'\\' \\\\641\\\\ If \\nmarket participants reach the conclusion that the Commission has set \\nappropriate minimum block sizes for a specific swap category in a way \\nthat will materially reduce market liquidity, then those participants \\nare encouraged to submit data to support their conclusion. In addition, \\nthe Commission will conduct its own surveillance of swaps market\\n\\n[[Page 32924]]\\n\\nactivity and how block sizes affect market liquidity in each of the \\nspecified swap categories.\\\\642\\\\ In response to either a submission or \\nits own surveillance of swaps market activity the Commission may \\nexercise its legal authority to take action by rule or order to \\nmitigate the potential effects on market liquidity with respect to \\nswaps in a particular swap category.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\641\\\\ 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(13)(E)(iv).\\n    \\\\642\\\\ The Commission received two comments supporting the \\nCommission\\'s authority to set appropriate minimum block sizes \\noutside of the proposed annual look-back period. MFA argued that the \\nCommission\\'s goal to balance transparency and liquidity would be \\nbetter achieved with the flexibility to adjust minimum block sizes \\nquickly to respond to material market changes. MFA recommended that \\nthe Commission should have the authority to update post-initial \\nminimum block sizes in extraordinary circumstances and on a case-by-\\ncase basis, based on SDR data that it receives for individual or \\nacross multiple swap categories. GFMA stated that if the Commission \\nestablishes a notional calculation test, then it should ensure that \\nit has sufficient flexibility to amend minimum block sizes. GFMA \\nrecommended that the Commission should be able to ``swiftly alter\\'\\' \\nblock trade levels to enable some trading to be conducted in a newly \\nilliquid market, without the benefit of reference to a data set. The \\nCommission notes that Sec.  43.6(f)(1) provides that the Commission \\nshall update post-initial appropriate minimum block levels ``[n]o \\nless than once each calendar year.\\'\\' Accordingly, the Commission \\nnotes that it has the ability to adjust post-initial minimum block \\nsizes under the types of extraordinary circumstances raised by \\ncommenters.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission acknowledges that the market depth and market \\nbreadth test is a viable alternative to the notional amount calculation \\nmethodology. However, it has several prerequisite conditions that \\ncomplicate the ability to implement it. For example, the Commission \\nwould need to determine which contracts within a swap category offer \\npre-trade price transparency--electronically displayed and executable \\nbids and offers as well as displayed available volumes for execution. \\nAs noted by commenters, adequate market trading data also must be \\navailable to collect a market depth snapshot of all of the bids and \\noffers for the pre-trade price transparency set of applicable \\ncontracts. The Commission is also cognizant of MFA\\'s concerns regarding \\nthe potential for manipulation of market depth. Given the time needed \\nfor trading infrastructure to develop and the significant time and cost \\nconsiderations involved in collecting such data from SEFs and DCMs, the \\nCommission deems it unfeasible to implement at this time; the \\nCommission will continue to examine the merits of doing so in the \\nfuture.\\n6. CEA Section 15(a) Factors\\na. Protection of Market Participants and the Public\\n    The Commission believes that the criteria and methodology in Sec.  \\n43.6(a)-(f) and (h) will protect swap market participants by extending \\nthe delay for reporting for publicly reportable swap transactions, as \\nappropriate, while also accommodating the market participant and public \\ninterest with enhanced transparency. By setting appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes in a thoughtful and measured manner as contemplated in the \\nfinal rule, the Commission believes that it has properly balanced the \\ntradeoff between transparency and liquidity interests. As a result, \\nswap market participants will retain a means to offset risk exposures \\nrelated to their swap transactions at competitive prices. In addition, \\nthe phased-in implementation scheme outlined in this rulemaking will \\nintroduce greater transparency in an incremental, measured and flexible \\nmanner so that appropriate minimum block sizes are responsive to \\nchanging markets. Specifically, the Commission expects that the \\navailability of real-time pricing information for carefully enumerated \\ncategories of swap transactions will draw increased swap market \\nliquidity through the competitive appeal of improved pricing efficiency \\nthat greater transparency affords. More liquid, competitive swap \\nmarkets, in turn, allow businesses to offset costs more efficiently \\nthan in completely opaque markets, thus serving the interests of both \\nmarket participants and the public who should benefit through lower \\ncosts of goods and services.\\n    Another benefit of increasing swaps market transparency to \\nregulators and the public in real-time, without the interim delays for \\nall transactions imposed in Part 43, is better protection of market \\nparticipants and the public by improving the Commission\\'s oversight \\nability and by giving academics, the media, public and market \\nparticipants the opportunity to monitor, study, and analyze these \\npreviously opaque segments of the economy.\\nb. Efficiency, Competitiveness and Financial Integrity of Markets \\\\643\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\643\\\\ The Commission sees no potential impact to the financial \\nintegrity of futures markets from the criteria and methodology in \\nits consideration of section 15(a)(2)(B) of the CEA. Although by its \\nterms, section 15(a)(2)(B) applies to futures, the Commission finds \\nthis factor useful in analyzing the costs and benefits of swaps \\nregulation, as well.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The criteria and methodology set out in the rules will promote \\nmarket efficiency, competitiveness and financial integrity of markets \\nin several ways. The Commission acknowledges that because \\nresponsibility for specifying swap categories and determining \\nappropriate minimum block sizes is with the Commission rather than \\nregistered entities, the administrative burden on swap market \\nparticipants is minimized. Further, the rules afford flexibility to \\nrespond to continuing swaps market evolution, including but not limited \\nto changing industry practices and activities that the Commission \\nforesees occurring as market participants comply with regulations, \\nincluding part 43, implementing the Dodd-Frank Act regulatory regime. \\nMore specifically, the methodology in Sec.  43.6(c)-(f) and (h) will \\nrecalibrate appropriate minimum block sizes regularly to ensure that \\nthose sizes remain appropriate for, and responsive to, these changing \\nmarkets. This ability, coupled with the potential for the Commission to \\nadjust futures block requirements in pending and future rulemakings \\n(among other tools) also helps assure that competitive implications \\nthat could arise between substitutable swaps and futures as markets \\nevolve are appropriately addressed. The Commission believes that the \\nrules will introduce increased market transparency for swaps in a \\ncareful, measured manner that the Commission believes will optimize the \\nbalance between liquidity and transparency concerns.\\\\644\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\644\\\\ As noted above, under part 43 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations (as now promulgated in the Real-Time Reporting Final \\nRule), all publicly reportable swap transactions are subject to a \\ntime delay pending further amending regulation to establish the \\ncriteria and methodology to distinguish block trades and large \\nnotional off-facility swaps from those swaps that do not meet those \\ndefinitions. See 77 FR 1217. As a result, SDRs as of now are not \\nrequired to publicly disseminate publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions as soon as technologically practicable.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nc. Price Discovery\\n    The criteria and methodology set out in the rules will enhance swap \\nmarket price discovery by eliminating, to the extent appropriate, the \\ntime delays for the real-time public reporting. The methodology of this \\nfinal rule will ensure that an SDR will be able to publicly disseminate \\ndata for certain swaps as soon as technologically practicable and the \\nmajority of the transactions in the market will be visible to traders \\nas well as the public. Since the majority of trades will be published \\nand visible in real-time, reported prices are likely to be better \\nindicators of competitive pricing. As such, the rules promote improved \\nprice discovery.\\n\\n[[Page 32925]]\\n\\nd. Sound Risk Management Practices\\n    As discussed above, the Commission believes that the criteria and \\nmethodology set forth in the rules will enhance price discovery since \\nSDRs will publicly disseminate price and other data relevant to \\nvaluation as soon as technologically practicable for the swaps for \\nwhich the time-delay is lifted. This better and more accurate data will \\nenable swap market participants, generally, to better measure risk. An \\nability to better manage risk at an entity level should translate to \\nimproved market participant risk management generally. Improved risk \\nmeasurement and management potential, in turn, mitigates the risk of \\nanother financial crisis by better equipping market participants to \\nvalue their swap contracts and other assets during times of market \\ninstability.\\ne. Other Public Interest Considerations\\n    The Commission believes that the criteria and methodology in Sec.  \\n43.6(a)-(f) and (h) will allow the majority of swap transactions and \\nprices to be publicly disseminated, giving academics, the media, public \\nand market participants the opportunity to monitor, study, and analyze \\nthese previously opaque segments of the economy. This would allow the \\npublic to be better informed about swaps markets and analyze publicly \\navailable market data disseminated in real-time.\\n\\nD. Cost-Benefit Considerations Relevant to the Block Trade/Large \\nNotional Off-Facility Swap Election Process (Sec.  43.6(g))\\n\\n    Section 43.6(g) specifies the process for a market participant to \\nelect that a swap transaction be treated as a block trade or large \\nnotional off-facility swap (``the election process\\'\\'). Section \\n43.6(g)(1) establishes a two-step notification process relating to \\nblock trades. Section 43.6(g)(2) establishes the notification process \\nrelating to large notional off-facility swaps.\\n    Section 43.6(g)(1)(i) sets out the first step in the block trade \\nnotification process: parties to a swap executed at or above the \\nappropriate minimum block size for the applicable swap category are \\nrequired to notify the SEF or DCM, as applicable, of their election to \\nhave their qualifying swap transaction treated as a block trade. \\nSection 43.6(g)(1)(ii) sets out the second step: the SEF or DCM, as \\napplicable, that receives an election notification is required to \\nnotify an SDR of a block trade election when transmitting swap \\ntransaction and pricing data to such SDR for public dissemination. The \\nCommission expects SEFs and DCMs to use automated, electronic--and in \\nsome cases voice--processes to execute swap transactions; the \\ntransmission of the notification of a block trade election, which may \\noccur separately from the execution process, also will be either \\nautomated, electronic or communicated through voice processes.\\n    Section 43.6(g)(1)(ii) sets out the second step: the SEF or DCM, as \\napplicable, that receives an election notification is required to \\nnotify an SDR of a block trade election when transmitting swap \\ntransaction and pricing data to such SDR for public dissemination.\\n1. Costs Relevant to the Election Process (Sec.  43.6(g))\\n    Non-financial end-users who are reporting parties, as well as SEFs, \\nDCMs, and SDRs will likely bear the costs of complying with the \\nelection process in Sec.  43.6(g). To comply with the real-time \\nreporting requirements of part 43 already in place, these entities will \\nhave already invested in technology and personnel as well as \\nestablished programs for continued systems maintenance, support and \\ncompliance; the Commission has previously described and considered \\nthese costs in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule.\\\\645\\\\ The Commission \\nspecifically designed the election process so that non-financial end-\\nusers, SEFs, DCMs, and SDRs would be able to leverage any investments \\nmade for compliance with part 43 to also comply with Sec.  43.6(g). \\nAccordingly, the Commission expects non-financial end-users, SEFs, DCMs \\nand SDRs to have the following direct, quantifiable costs: (a) An \\nincremental, non-recurring expenditure to update existing technology to \\ncomply with Sec.  43.6(g); (b) an incremental non-recurring expenditure \\nfor training existing personnel and updating written policies and \\nprocedures for compliance with amendments to part 43; (c) incremental \\nrecurring expenses associated with compliance, maintenance and \\noperational support in connection with the election process; and (d) \\nadditional incremental, non-recurring expenditures to update existing \\ntechnology exclusive to SDRs. SDRs also would have incremental, non-\\nrecurring expenditures to update existing technology.\\\\646\\\\ The \\nCommission also recognizes that the election process in Sec.  43.6(g) \\nis voluntary and that eligible entities would not elect block trade \\ntreatment for a swap transaction in circumstances in which they did not \\nperceive a net benefit in doing so. In the paragraphs that follow, the \\nCommission discusses each of these costs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\645\\\\ See 77 FR 1237. As noted in the Real-Time Reporting Final \\nRule, non-financial end-users (that do not contract with a third \\nparty) will have initial costs consisting of: (i) Developing an \\ninternal order management system capable of capturing all relevant \\ndata ($26,689 per non-financial end-user) and a recurring annual \\nburden of ($27,943 per non-financial end-user); (ii) establishing \\nconnectivity with an SDR that accepts data ($12,824 per non-\\nfinancial end-user); (iii) developing written policies and \\nprocedures to ensure compliance with part 43 ($14,793 per non-\\nfinancial end-user); and (iv) compliance with error correction \\nprocedures ($2,063 per non-financial end-user). See id. With respect \\nto recurring costs, a non-financial end-user will have: (i) \\nRecurring costs for compliance, maintenance and operational support \\n($13,747 per non-financial end-user); (ii) recurring costs to \\nmaintain connectivity to an SDR ($100,000 per non-financial end-\\nuser); and (iii) recurring costs to maintain systems for purposes of \\nreporting errors or omissions ($1,366 per non-financial end user). \\nSee id.\\n    SDRs (that do not enter into contracts with a third party) would \\nhave incremental costs related to compliance with part 43 beyond \\nthose costs identified in the release adopting part 49 of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations. See Swap Data Repositories: Registration \\nStandards, Duties and Core Principles, 76 FR 54538 (Sept. 1, 2011). \\nIn the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission stated that \\neach SDR would have: (i) A recurring burden of approximately \\n$856,666 and an annual burden of $666,666 for system maintenance per \\nSDR; (ii) non-recurring costs to publicly disseminate ($601,003 per \\nSDR); and (iii) recurring cots to publicly disseminate ($360,602 per \\nSDR). See id.\\n    In the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission assumed \\nthat SEFs and DCMs will experience the same or lower costs as a non-\\nfinancial end-user. See id.\\n    \\\\646\\\\ SDRs that do not enter into contracts with a third party \\nwould have incremental costs related to compliance with part 43 of \\nthe Commission\\'s regulations beyond those cost identified in the \\nrelease adopting part 49 of the Commission\\'s regulations. See Swap \\nData Repositories: Registration Standards, Duties and Core \\nPrinciples, 76 FR 54538 (Sept. 1, 2011). In the Real-Time Reporting \\nFinal Rule, the Commission stated that each SDR would have: (1) A \\nrecurring burden of approximately $856,666 and an annual burden of \\n$666,666 for system maintenance per SDR; (2) non-recurring costs to \\npublicly disseminate ($601,003 per SDR); and (3) recurring costs to \\npublicly disseminate ($360,602 per SDR). See id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\na. Incremental, Non-Recurring Expenditure to a Non-Financial End-User, \\nSEF or DCM to Update Existing Technology \\\\647\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\647\\\\ For the same reasons stated in the Real-Time Reporting \\nFinal Rule, the Commission assumes that SEFs and DCMs would \\nexperience the same or less costs as a non-financial end-user. See \\n77 FR 1236. Under Sec.  43.6(g)(1), SEFs or DCMs would be required \\nto transmit a block trade election to an SDR only when the SEF or \\nDCM receives notice of a block trade election from a reporting \\nparty.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To comply with the election process in Sec.  43.6(g), a non-\\nfinancial end-user, SEF, or DCM likely would need to: (1) Update its \\nOrder Management System (``OMS\\'\\') to capture the election to treat a \\nqualifying publicly reportable swap transaction as a block trade or \\nlarge notional off-facility swap. In the Further Block Proposal, the \\nCommission\\n\\n[[Page 32926]]\\n\\nestimated that updating an OMS system to permit notification to an SDR \\nof a block trade or large notional off-facility swap election would \\nimpose an initial non-recurring burden of approximately 80 personnel \\nhours at an approximate cost of $6,761 for each non-financial end-user, \\nSEF or DCM.\\\\648\\\\ This cost estimate included an estimate of the number \\nof potential burden hours required to amend internal procedures, \\nreprogram systems and implement processes to permit a non-financial \\nend-user to elect to treat their qualifying swap transaction as a block \\ntrade or large notional off-facility swap in compliance with the \\nrequirements set forth in Sec.  43.6(g). The Commission is revising its \\nestimates based on updated wage rate data. The Commission estimates \\nthat updating an OMS system to permit notification to an SDR of a block \\ntrade or large notional off-facility swap election would impose an \\ninitial non-recurring burden of approximately 80 personnel hours at an \\napproximate cost of $7,171 for each non-financial end-user, SEF or \\nDCM.\\\\649\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\648\\\\ This estimate was calculated as follows: (Compliance \\nManager at 15 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 10 hours) + \\n(Compliance Attorney at 5 hours) + (Senior Systems Analyst at 30) + \\n(Senior Programmer at 20) = 80 hours per non-financial end-user who \\nis a reporting party. A compliance manager has adjusted hourly wages \\nof $77.77. A director of compliance has adjusted hourly wages of \\n$158.21. A compliance attorney has adjusted hourly wages of $89.43. \\nA senior systems analyst has adjusted hourly wages of $64.50. A \\nsenior programmer has adjusted hourly wages of $81.52.\\n    \\\\649\\\\ This estimate was calculated as follows: (Compliance \\nManager at 15 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 10 hours) + \\n(Compliance Attorney at 5 hours) + (Senior Systems Analyst at 30) + \\n(Senior Programmer at 20) = 80 hours per non-financial end-user who \\nis a reporting party. A compliance manager has adjusted hourly wages \\nof $74.16. A director of compliance adjusted hourly wages of \\n$169.16. A compliance attorney has adjusted hourly wages of $103.17. \\nA senior systems analyst has adjusted hourly wages of $70.45. A \\nsenior programmer has adjusted hourly wages of $86.89.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb. Incremental, Non-Recurring Expenditure to a Non-Financial End-User \\nto Provide Training To Existing Personnel and Update Written Policies \\nand Procedures\\n    To comply with the election process in Sec.  43.6(g), a non-\\nfinancial end-user likely would need to provide training to its \\nexisting personnel and update its written policies and procedures to \\naccount for this new process. In the Further Block Proposal, the \\nCommission estimated that providing training to existing personnel and \\nupdating written policies and procedures would impose an initial non-\\nrecurring burden of approximately 39 personnel hours at an approximate \\ncost of $3,200 for each non-financial end-user.\\\\650\\\\ This cost estimate \\nincluded the number of potential burden hours required to produce \\ndesign training materials, conduct training with existing personnel, \\nand revise and circulate written policies and procedures in compliance \\nwith the requirements set forth in Sec.  43.6(g). The Commission is \\nrevising its estimates based on updated wage rate data. The Commission \\nestimates that providing training to existing personnel and updating \\nwritten policies and procedures would impose an initial non-recurring \\nburden of approximately 39 personnel hours at an approximate cost of \\n$3,360 for each non-financial end-user.\\\\651\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\650\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Compliance \\nManager at 5 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 2 hours) + \\n(Compliance Attorney at 2 hours) + (Senior Systems Analyst at 10) + \\n(Senior Programmer at 20) = 39 hours per non-financial end-user who \\nis a reporting party. A compliance manager has adjusted hourly wages \\nof $77.77.\\n    \\\\651\\\\ This estimate was calculated as follows: (Compliance \\nManager at 5 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 2 hours) + \\n(Compliance Attorney at 2 hours) + (Senior Systems Analyst at 10) + \\n(Senior Programmer at 20) = 39 hours per non-financial end-user who \\nis a reporting party. A compliance manager has adjusted hourly wages \\nof $74.16. A director of compliance adjusted hourly wages of \\n$169.16. A compliance attorney has adjusted hourly wages of $103.17. \\nA senior systems analyst has adjusted hourly wages of $70.45. A \\nsenior programmer has adjusted hourly wages of $86.89.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nc. Incremental, Recurring Expenses to a Non-Financial End-User, DCM or \\nSEF Associated With Incremental Compliance, Maintenance and Operational \\nSupport in Connection With the Election Process\\n    A non-financial end-user, DCM or SEF likely would incur costs on an \\nannual basis in order to comply with the election process in Sec.  \\n43.6(g). In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission estimated that \\nannual compliance; maintenance and operation support would impose an \\nincremental, recurring burden of approximately five personnel hours at \\nan approximate cost of $340 for each non-financial end-user, DCM or \\nSEF.\\\\652\\\\ This cost estimate included the number of potential burden \\nhours required to design training materials, conduct training with \\nexisting personnel, and revise and circulate written policies and \\nprocedures in compliance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  \\n43.6(g). The Commission is revising its estimates based on updated wage \\nrate data. The Commission estimates the updated approximate cost of \\ndesigning training materials, conducting training with existing \\npersonnel, and revising and circulating written policies and procedures \\nin compliance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  43.6(g) to be \\n$370 for each non-financial end-user, DCM, or SEF.\\\\653\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\652\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Director of \\nCompliance at 1 hour) + (Compliance Clerk at 3 hours) + (Compliance \\nAttorney at 1 hour) = 5 hours per year per non-financial end-user \\nwho is a reporting party. A director of compliance has adjusted \\nhourly wages of $158.21. A compliance clerk (junior compliance \\nadvisor) has adjusted hourly wages of $31.22. A compliance attorney \\nhas adjusted hourly wages of 89.43.\\n    \\\\653\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Director of \\nCompliance at 1 hour) + (Compliance Clerk at 3 hours) + (Compliance \\nAttorney at 1 hour) = 5 hours per year per non-financial end-user \\nwho is a reporting party. A director of compliance\\'s adjusted hourly \\nwage is $169.16. A compliance clerk (junior compliance advisor) has \\nadjusted hourly wages of $33.52. A compliance attorney\\'s adjusted \\nhourly wage is $103.17.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nd. Incremental, Non-Recurring Expenditure to an SDR To Update Existing \\nTechnology To Capture and Publicly Disseminate Swap Data for Block \\nTrades and Large Notional Off-Facility Swaps\\n    To comply with the election process in Sec.  43.6(g), an SDR likely \\nwould need to update its existing technology to capture elections and \\ndisseminate qualifying publicly reportable swap transactions as block \\ntrades or large notional off-facility swaps. In the Further Block \\nProposal, the Commission estimated that updating existing technology to \\ncapture elections would impose an initial non-recurring burden of \\napproximately 15 personnel hours at an approximate cost of $1,310 for \\neach SDR.\\\\654\\\\ This cost estimate included the number of potential \\nburden hours required to amend internal procedures, reprogram systems, \\nand implement processes to capture and publicly disseminate swap \\ntransaction and pricing data for block trades and large notional off-\\nfacility swaps in compliance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  \\n43.6(g). The Commission is revising its estimates based on updated wage \\nrate data. The Commission estimates the updated approximate cost \\nrequired to amend internal procedures, reprogram systems, and implement \\nprocesses to capture and publicly disseminate swap transaction and \\npricing data for block trades and large notional off-facility swaps in \\ncompliance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  43.6(g) to be \\n$1,390 for each SDR.\\\\655\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\654\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Sr. Programmer at \\n8 hours) + (Sr. Systems Analyst at 3 hours) + (Compliance Manager at \\n2 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 2 hours) = 15 hours per SDR. A \\nsenior programmer has adjusted hourly wages of $81.52. A senior \\nsystems analyst has adjusted hourly wages of $64.50. A compliance \\nmanager has adjusted hourly wages of $77.77. A director of \\ncompliance has adjusted hourly wages of $158.21.\\n    \\\\655\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Senior Programmer \\nat 8 hours) + (Senior Systems Analyst at 3 hours) + (Compliance \\nManager at 2 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 2 hours) = 15 hours \\nper SDR. A senior programmer has adjusted hourly wages of $86.89. A \\nsenior systems analyst has adjusted hourly wages of $70.45. A \\ncompliance manager has adjusted hourly wages of $74.16. A director \\nof compliance has adjusted hourly wages of $169.16.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 32927]]\\n\\n2. Comments Received\\n    The Commission received one comment directly related to the costs \\nof the election process. As discussed more fully above, WMBAA disagreed \\nwith the Further Block Proposal projected cost estimates generally and \\ncontended that the Commission failed to contemplate the actual efforts \\na SEF will have to undertake to implement the block trade regime, \\nincluding the two-step notification process.\\\\656\\\\ In addition to the \\nfact that WMBAA did not provide data to support or monetize its \\nposition, WMBAA\\'s disagreement with the Further Block Proposal\\'s \\nelection process cost estimates does not concern the incremental cost \\nto augment and maintain systems and processes that the Commission \\nbelieves entities need have in place to comply with the real time \\nreporting requirement of Section 2(a)(13) of the CEA; rather it \\nconcerns the cost to comply with that statutory requirement as \\nprescribed by the existing part 43 implementation regulations. SEFs and \\nDCMs would incur these costs regardless of how the Commission \\ndetermines block thresholds. Accordingly, the Commission considers \\nWMBAA\\'s criticism of the cost estimates in this rulemaking misplaced. \\nTherefore, the Commission is maintaining the Further Block Proposal\\'s \\napproach to calculating the direct costs resulting from the methodology \\nfor determining block thresholds, but is revising its estimates based \\non updated wage rate data.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\656\\\\ CL-WMBAA at 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Benefits Relevant to the Election Process (Sec.  43.6(g))\\n    The Commission has identified two overarching benefits that the \\nelection process in Sec.  43.6(g) would confer on swap market \\nparticipants, registered entities and the general public. First, \\nalthough Sec.  43.6(g) sets out a purely administrative process with \\nwhich market participants and registered entities must comply, the \\nCommission views this process as an integral component of the block \\ntrade framework in this rulemaking and in part 43. Consequently, this \\nelection process will benefit market participants, registered entities \\nand the general public by providing greater price transparency in swaps \\nmarkets than currently exists under part 43.\\\\657\\\\ Since this election \\nprocess is optional, entities need avail themselves of the process only \\nin circumstances where the attendant benefits warrant.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\657\\\\ See the discussion of benefits in section VI.E.1.e above \\nwith respect to Sec.  43.6(a)-(f) and (h).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Second, the Commission believes that the election process will \\npromote market efficiency by creating a standardized process in Sec.  \\n43.6(g) for market participants to designate publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions that are eligible for block trade or large notional off-\\nfacility swap treatment. In addition, this standardized process will \\nfurther promote efficiency by allowing market participants and \\nregistered entities to leverage their existing technology \\ninfrastructure, connectivity, personnel and other resources required \\nunder parts 43 and 49 of the Commission\\'s regulations. The Commission \\nbelieves the final rule avoids imposing duplicative or conflicting \\nobligations on market participants and registered entities.\\n4. Alternatives\\n    The Commission specifically asked commenters whether there were \\nalternative methods through which a reporting party could elect to \\ntreat its qualifying swap transaction as a block trade or large \\nnotional off-facility swap. In addition, the Commission asked whether \\nit should require a variation on the proposed election process where \\nSEFs, DCMs, and reporting parties would be required to indicate under \\nwhich swap category they were claiming block or large notional off-\\nfacility swap treatment. Finally, the Commission asked whether it \\nshould establish an alternative approach for small end-users when such \\nan end-user is the reporting party to a qualified swap transaction.\\n    No comments were received either proposing or otherwise supporting \\nan alternative approach and as such, the Commission is adopting in \\nSec.  43.6(g) relative to possible alternatives.\\n5. Application of the Section 15(a) Factors to Sec.  43.6(g)\\na. Protection of Market Participants and the Public\\n    Section 43.6(g) is an essential part of this rulemaking because it \\nprovides the mechanism through which market participants will be able \\nto elect to treat their qualifying swap transaction as a block trade or \\nlarge notional off-facility swap. Consequently, this process \\ncontributes to providing greater swap market transparency than what \\ncurrently exists under part 43 of the Commission\\'s regulations. Market \\nparticipants, registered entities and the general public benefit from \\nthis enhanced swap market price transparency.\\nb. Efficiency, Competitiveness and Financial Integrity.\\\\658\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\658\\\\ Although by its terms, section 15(a)(2)(B) of the CEA \\napplies to futures and not swaps, the Commission finds this factor \\nuseful in analyzing the costs and benefits of regulating swaps, as \\nwell. See 7 U.S.C. 19(a)(2)(B).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As noted above, the election process will promote efficiency by \\nproviding market participants and registered entities with a \\nstandardized process to delineate which publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions are block trades or large notional off-facility swaps. The \\nvoluntary nature of this election process will also add to the \\nefficiency of the swaps market since eligible entities will only choose \\nto elect if it is financially beneficial for them to do so. In \\naddition, the proposed election process will promote efficiency by \\nallowing non-financial end-users, SEFs, DCMs and SDRs to leverage their \\nexisting technology infrastructure, connectivity, personnel and other \\nresources required under part 43 and part 49 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations. The use of existing technologies, connectivity, personnel \\nand other resources will create efficiencies for these entities and \\nmitigate the cost to comply Sec.  43.6(g).\\n    The Commission has identified no potential impact on \\ncompetitiveness and financial integrity that would result from the \\nimplementation of the proposed election process.\\nc. Price Discovery\\n    The Commission has identified no potential material impact to price \\ndiscovery that would result from the implementation of the election \\nprocess outside of those discussed in section b. above.\\nd. Sound Risk Management Practices\\n    The Commission has identified no potential impact on sound risk \\nmanagement practices that would result from the implementation of the \\nelection process outside of those discussed in section b. above.\\ne. Other Public Interest Considerations\\n    The Commission has identified no potential impact on other public \\ninterest considerations (other than those identified above) that would \\nresult from the implementation of the election process.\\n\\n[[Page 32928]]\\n\\nE. Costs and Benefits Relevant to Anonymity Protections (Amendments to \\nSec.  43.4(d)(4) and (h))\\n\\n    This section discusses the two amendments to Sec.  43.4. Section \\n43.4 as now promulgated prescribes the manner in which SDRs must \\npublicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data. One amendment \\nadds a system for masking the geographical data for certain swaps in \\nthe other commodity asset class not currently subject to public \\ndissemination, which provides limited, but not detailed information on \\nthe geographic location of the underlying assets of those swaps. The \\nother amendment establishes a methodology to establish cap sizes that \\nmasks the size of swap transactions above a certain threshold, which is \\ndifferent from the methodology for determining appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes. Both amendments seek to protect the anonymity of the \\nparties and certain identifying information for swaps while also \\nproviding increased transparency in swaps markets.\\n1. Amendments to Sec.  43.4(d)(4)\\n    The Commission addresses the public dissemination of information \\nregarding certain swaps in the other commodity asset class in Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4). Section 43.4(d)(4)(ii) currently provides that for publicly \\nreportable swaps in this commodity asset class, information identifying \\nthe underlying assets of the swap must be publicly disseminated for: \\n(a) those swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM; \\n(b) those swaps referencing one of the contracts described in appendix \\nB to part 43; and (c) any publicly reportable swap transaction that is \\neconomically related to one of the contracts described in appendix B to \\npart 43. Pursuant to the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, any swap that \\nis in the other commodity asset class that falls under Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(ii) will be subject to reporting and public dissemination \\nrequirements.\\n    In this final rule, the Commission is adopting a new provision, \\nSec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii), that prescribes a system for the public \\ndissemination of exact underlying assets in the other commodity asset \\nclass with a ``mask\\'\\' for sensitive and potentially revealing \\ngeographic detail. The Commission also is adopting guidance in the form \\nof a new appendix to part 43 that contains the geographical details \\nthat SDRs will be able to use in masking eligible other commodity swaps \\nwhile maintaining compliance with public dissemination of swap \\ntransaction and pricing data.\\n2. Amendments to Sec.  43.4(h)\\n    Section 43.4(h) establishes cap sizes for ``rounded notional or \\nprincipal swap amounts\\'\\' above which information on swaps transactions \\nis publicly reportable, for the purpose of providing anonymity for \\ntransactions where information on the notional or principal amounts \\nalone would likely reveal the identity of the parties to the swap or \\nsensitive business information. In doing so, the Commission notes that \\nthe objective of establishing cap sizes differs from that of \\nestablishing appropriate minimum block sizes.\\\\659\\\\ With respect to the \\nlatter, the objective is to ensure that a block trade or large notional \\noff-facility swap can be sufficiently offset during a relatively short \\nreporting delay. The former is strictly for the protection of the \\ncounterparties\\' identity and sensitive business information.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\659\\\\ The Commission received numerous comments suggesting that \\nthe block thresholds and cap sizes established by the Commission \\nshould be the same. However, block thresholds and cap sizes have \\ndifferent statutory mandates and serve different purposes.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section 43.4(h) currently requires SDRs to publicly disseminate the \\nnotional or principal amounts of a publicly reportable swap transaction \\nrepresented by a cap size (i.e., $XX+) that adjusts in accordance with \\nthe respective appropriate minimum block size for the relevant swap \\ncategory. Section 43.4(h) further provides that if no appropriate \\nminimum block size exists with respect to a swap category, then the cap \\nsize on the notional or principal amount will correspond with interim \\ncap sizes that the Commission has established for the five asset \\nclasses.\\\\660\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\660\\\\ See note 470 supra, which lists the interim cap sizes set \\nforth in Sec.  43.4(h)(1)-(5).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The amendment to Sec.  43.4(h) will require SDRs to continue to \\npublicly disseminate cap sizes that correspond to their respective \\nappropriate minimum block sizes during the initial period. However, \\nwhen the Commission publishes the post-initial appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes in accordance with Sec.  43.6(f), it will also publish \\npost-initial cap sizes for each swap category by applying a 75-percent \\nnotional amount calculation on data collected by SDRs. The Commission \\nwill apply the 75-percent notional amount calculation to a one-year \\nrolling window of such data corresponding to each relevant swap \\ncategory for each calendar year.\\n3. Costs Relevant to the Amendments to Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and (h)\\n    SDRs will bear some costs of complying with the amendments to Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4) and (h).\\\\661\\\\ The Commission set forth the potential costs \\nof these provisions in the Further Block Proposal and requested \\ncomments regarding its estimates. The Commission did not receive any \\ncomments regarding its estimates.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\661\\\\ The Commission anticipates that reporting parties, SEFs \\nand DCMs would not incur any new costs related to the amendments to \\nSec.  43.4 because this section relates to the data that an SDR must \\npublicly disseminate. Section 43.3 of the Commission\\'s regulations \\nsets out the requirements for reporting parties, SEFs and DCMs in \\nterms of what is transmitted to an SDR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission anticipates that these entities already will have \\nmade non-recurring expenditures in technology and personnel in \\nconnection with the requirements set forth in part 43 and part 49 \\n(which contain rules regarding the registration and regulation of \\nSDRs). As such, SDRs already will be required to pay recurring expenses \\nassociated with systems maintenance, support and compliance as \\ndescribed in the cost-benefit discussion in the Real-Time Reporting \\nFinal Rule.\\\\662\\\\ Notwithstanding these recurring expenses, an SDR will \\nhave additional non-recurring expenditures associated with the \\namendments to Sec.  43.4. Specifically, the Commission estimated that \\nupdating existing technology will impose an initial non-recurring \\nburden of approximately 34 personnel hours at an approximate cost of \\n$3,190 for each SDR.\\\\663\\\\ This cost estimate included an estimate of \\nthe number of potential burden hours required to amend internal \\nprocedures, reprogram systems and implement processes to capture and \\npublicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data for block trades \\nand large notional off-facility swaps in\\n\\n[[Page 32929]]\\n\\ncompliance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  43.4(d).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\662\\\\ See 76 FR 54572-75. As noted in SDR final rule, SDRs (that \\ndo not enter into contracts with a third party) would have \\nincremental costs related to compliance with part 43 beyond those \\ncosts identified in the release adopting part 49 of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations. See 76 FR 54573. In the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, \\nthe Commission stated that each SDR would have: (i) A recurring \\nburden of approximately $856,666 and an annual burden of $666,666 \\nfor system maintenance per SDR; (ii) non-recurring costs to publicly \\ndisseminate ($601,003 per SDR); and (iii) recurring cots to publicly \\ndisseminate ($360,602 per SDR). See 77 FR 1238.\\n    \\\\663\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Sr. Programmer at \\n20 hours) + (Sr. Systems Analyst at 10 hours) + (Compliance Manager \\nat 2 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 2 hours) = 34 hours per \\nSDR. A senior programmer has adjusted hourly wages of $81.52. A \\nsenior systems analyst has adjusted hourly wages of $64.50. A \\ncompliance manager has adjusted hourly wages of $77.77. A director \\nof compliance has adjusted hourly wages of $158.21. The total number \\nwas calculated incorrectly in the Further Block Proposal. The \\ninitial cost to an SDR should have been $2,747, rather than $3,190.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is revising its estimates based on updated wage rate \\ndata. The Commission estimates the updated approximate cost required to \\namend internal procedures, reprogram systems and implement processes to \\ncapture and publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data for \\nblock trades and large notional off-facility swaps in compliance with \\nthe requirements set forth in Sec.  43.4(d) to be $2,930 for each \\nSDR.\\\\664\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\664\\\\ This estimate is calculated as follows: (Sr. Programmer at \\n20 hours) + (Sr. Systems Analyst at 10 hours) + (Compliance Manager \\nat 2 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 2 hours) = 34 hours per \\nSDR. A senior programmer has adjusted hourly wages of $86.89. A \\nsenior systems analyst has adjusted hourly wages of $70.45. A \\ncompliance manager has adjusted hourly wages of $74.16. A director \\nof compliance has adjusted hourly wages of $169.16.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In addition, the Commission believes that Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) \\nwill result in some incremental, recurring costs for SDRs because they \\nwill be required to publicly disseminate other commodity swaps data \\nthat were not previously within the scope of the public dissemination \\nrequirement in Sec.  43.4. The Commission estimates that there will be \\napproximately 50,000 additional swaps reported to an SDR each year in \\nthe other commodity asset class, which the Commission estimates will be \\n$154,021 in annualized costs.\\\\665\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\665\\\\ The Commission estimates that there will be 5 SDRs, which \\nwill collect swaps data in the other commodity asset class. Each SDR \\nwould collect swaps data on approximately 10,000 swap transactions \\nin the other commodity asset class. The commission estimates that it \\nwill take each SDR on average approximately 1 minute to publicly \\ndisseminate swaps data related to these new swap transactions. The \\nnumber of burden hours for these SDRs would be 833 hours. As \\nreferenced in note 523 supra, the total labor costs for a swap \\ntrader is $184.90. Thus, the total number of burden hour costs equal \\nthe total number of burden hours (833 burden hours) x $184.90.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission also anticipates that Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) will \\nresult in some indirect costs to the market through reduced \\ninformation, since notional values of transactions beyond the cap size \\nlimits will not be revealed to the public. The Commission lacks data to \\nquantify the costs associated with the reduction of information. \\nHowever, given the statutory mandate to protect market participant \\nidentities, the Commission believes such costs are warranted and \\ncontemplated by Congress.\\n    The Commission also received a number of comments regarding \\npotential costs arising from the established level for cap size. GFMA \\nstated that the same rationale should apply to cap and block sizes, as \\nboth have potential negative impacts on liquidity.\\\\666\\\\ ICI stated that \\nthe 75 percent notional amount would be too high for determining cap \\nsize because the lack of depth and liquidity in the swaps market could \\ncause public reporting of block sizes to reveal identities, business \\ntransactions, and market positions of participants, and recommends a 67 \\npercent notional amount calculation for determining cap size in the \\npost-initial period.\\\\667\\\\ ISDA/SIFMA stated that the added transparency \\nfrom reporting transaction sizes between 67 percent and 75 percent \\nwould be outweighed by the harm to liquidity from additional \\ndisclosure, and urges the Commission to ensure that the post-initial \\ncap size is always equal to the relevant block size.\\\\668\\\\ MFA stated \\nthat it is unnecessary for the Commission to establish cap sizes that \\ndiffer from minimum block sizes as there is not a meaningful \\ntransparency benefit that would outweigh the resource burdens on the \\nCommission, SDRs, SEFs, and other market participants.\\\\669\\\\ SIFMA \\nstated that the Commission should set the notional cap size at the \\nblock threshold, as the added public dissemination could harm liquidity \\nin the same manner that a higher block trade size threshold might.\\\\670\\\\ \\nVanguard stated that it is essential that the cap match the block trade \\nthreshold, as to do otherwise would compromise the liquidity \\nprotections afforded by the nuanced assessment of block trade \\nthresholds.\\\\671\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\666\\\\ CL-GFMA at 5.\\n    \\\\667\\\\ CL-ICI at 8.\\n    \\\\668\\\\ CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 15.\\n    \\\\669\\\\ CL-MFA at 8-9.\\n    \\\\670\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 12.\\n    \\\\671\\\\ CL-Vanguard at 7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The additional information provided to the market regarding the \\nsize of block trades that are below the cap size may enhance price \\ndiscovery by publicly disseminating more information relating to market \\ndepth and the notional sizes of publicly reportable swap transactions. \\nThis, in turn, promotes increased market liquidity.\\n    In addition, the rule incorporates flexibility to adjust post-\\ninitial cap sizes in response to changing markets. Section 43.4(h) will \\npermit the Commission to set cap sizes no less than once annually \\nduring the post-initial period. If swap market conditions change \\nsignificantly after the implementation of the provisions of this \\nrulemaking, then the Commission can react in a timely manner to further \\nimprove price transparency or to mitigate adverse effects on market \\nliquidity.\\\\672\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\672\\\\ This benefit is consistent with one of the considerations \\nfor implementation identified by ISDA and SIFMA in their January 18, \\n2011 report. See Block trade reporting for over-the-counter \\nderivatives markets, note 32 supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n4. Benefits Relevant to the Amendments to Sec.  43.4\\n    The Commission anticipates that the anonymity provisions of Sec.  \\n43.4 will generate several overarching benefits to swap market \\nparticipants, registered entities and the general public. In the first \\ninstance, the Commission anticipates that the cap size amendments to \\nSec.  43.4(h) will benefit market participants, registered entities and \\nthe general public by providing greater price transparency with respect \\nto swaps with notional amounts that fall between the post-initial \\nappropriate minimum block size and post-initial cap size for a \\nparticular swap category. During the post-initial period, the \\nCommission will set appropriate minimum block sizes based on the 67 \\npercent notional amount calculation \\\\673\\\\ and cap sizes based on the \\n75-percent notional amount calculation.\\\\674\\\\ Although swaps with \\nnotional amounts that fall between these two sizes will be subject to a \\ntime delay, the exact notional amounts of these swaps eventually will \\nbe publicly disclosed. The delayed public disclosure of the notional \\namount of these swaps will provide market participants, registered \\nentities and the general public with meaningful price transparency.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\673\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(1).\\n    \\\\674\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(2).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The masking provisions in the amendment to Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and \\nappendix D to part 43 will further benefit market participants, \\nregistered entities and the general public by enhancing price discovery \\nwith respect to swaps that currently are not required to be publicly \\ndisclosed under part 43. Section 43.4(d)(4) currently requires SDRs to \\npublicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data for publicly \\nreportable swap transactions that reference or are economically related \\nto the 29 contracts identified in appendix B to part 43. However, the \\nCommission believes there are a significant number of swaps in the \\nother commodity asset class that are not economically related to the 29 \\ncontracts identified on this appendix to part 43. The amendment \\ncreating new Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) will require the public \\ndissemination of data on these swaps. The real-time public reporting of \\nthese swaps will enhance price discovery in the other commodity asset \\nclass.\\n\\n[[Page 32930]]\\n\\n    In addition, the rule incorporates flexibility to adjust post-\\ninitial cap sizes in response to changing markets. Section 43.4(h) will \\npermit the Commission to set cap sizes no less than once annually \\nduring the post-initial period. If swap market conditions change \\nsignificantly after the implementation of the provisions of this \\nrulemaking, then the Commission can react in a timely manner to further \\nimprove price transparency or to mitigate adverse effects on market \\nliquidity.\\\\675\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\675\\\\ This benefit is consistent with one of the considerations \\nfor implementation identified by ISDA and SIFMA in their January 18, \\n2011 report. See Block trade reporting for over-the-counter \\nderivatives markets, note 32 supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n5. Alternatives\\n    The Commission received numerous comments supporting alternatives \\nto the proposed anonymity provisions in Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and (h). These \\nalternatives fall into two basic categories: (1) Post-initial cap size \\nlevel; and (2) preventing public disclosure of swap market participant \\nidentity. In regard to cap size, seven commenters recommended that the \\nCommission set post-initial cap sizes matching the minimum block size \\nthresholds established by the Commission. AII supported setting the \\npost-initial cap size for each swap category at the same level as the \\nblock size threshold and states that the 75 percent notional amount \\ncalculation is far too high.\\\\676\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\676\\\\ CL-AII at 12.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For the initial period, AII and ISDA/SIFMA argued that the cap size \\nshould be the lower of block size and the interim cap size in Sec.  \\n43.4(h)(1).\\\\677\\\\ Barclays recommended that the post initial period cap \\nsizes be introduced at more nuanced levels that reflect the differences \\nbetween product\\'s traded volumes.\\\\678\\\\ EEI stated that the initial cap \\nsize of $25 million for both the Electricity Swap Contracts and the \\nOther Commodity Electricity Swap Category is too high, as is the 75 \\npercent notional amount for the post-initial period. EEI recommended \\nthat the Commission adopt a fixed cap size of $3 million for both \\nperiods.\\\\679\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\677\\\\ CL-AII at 12; CL-ISDA/SIFMA at 15.\\n    \\\\678\\\\ CL-Barclays at 6.\\n    \\\\679\\\\ CL-EEI at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission has evaluated these various alternatives concerning \\npost-initial cap size levels against the statutory requirements imposed \\nupon it by Section 2(a)(13): bring real-time public reporting to the \\nswaps market subject to time delays for block trades and large notional \\noff-facility swaps that it determines appropriate.\\\\680\\\\ However, the \\nstatute only calls for a time delay--it does not provide for \\ninformation to be kept from the market in perpetuity. All of the \\ninformation regarding a block trade is reported to the market at the \\nend of the block time delay. Notional or principal amount information \\nabove cap sizes, on the other hand, is never expressed to the market. \\nBecause the notional amount of the trade is neither reported to the \\nmarket in real-time, nor reported to the market at all, the Commission \\nbelieves that cap sizes should be set at a higher level than block \\nsizes. The 75 percent notional test balances the competing interests of \\nproviding meaningful real-time public reporting to the swaps market and \\nprotecting the anonymity of swap market participants, while taking into \\naccount potential impacts on market liquidity.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\680\\\\ Section 2(a)(13)(E) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The additional information provided to the market regarding the \\nsize of block trades that are below the cap size may enhance price \\ndiscovery by publicly disseminating more information relating to market \\ndepth and the notional sizes of publicly reportable swap transactions. \\nThis, in turn, promotes increased market liquidity.\\n    In regard to alternatives for preventing the public disclosure of \\nthe identities of swap market participants, the Commission received \\nthree comments regarding the masking of specific delivery or pricing \\ndetail of energy and power swaps. EEI recommended that the Commission \\nmask data regarding Other Commodity Electricity Swaps according to the \\nNorth American Electric Reliability Corporation eight regions rather \\nthan the FERC regions proposed.\\\\681\\\\ Barclays recommended that the \\nCommission use wider geographic regions when publicly disseminating \\ndata for commodity swaps with very specific underlying assets and/or \\ndelivery points and develop an appropriate process to avoid identifying \\nissuers of debt.\\\\682\\\\ Spring Trading supported further measures to \\nprevent public disclosure of identities, business transactions, and \\nmarket positions of swap market participants, and recommended \\ndisclosing a subset of data on a collective basis at a later date.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\681\\\\ CL-EEI at 12-13.\\n    \\\\682\\\\ CL-Barclays at 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    After consideration of the alternatives suggested by commenters, \\nthe Commission is adopting Sec.  43.4(d)(iii) with the following \\nmodification that it believes affords greater anonymity protection \\nrelative to the Further Block Proposal, without adversely impacting \\ntransparency. The modification is: For publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions that have electricity and sources as an underlying asset \\nand have a specific delivery or pricing point in the United States, the \\nCommission is requiring SDRs to public disseminate the specific \\ndelivery or pricing point based on a description of one of the North \\nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation (``NERC\\'\\') regions for \\npublicly disseminating delivery or pricing points for electricity swaps \\ndescribed in proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii). Using the regions \\nsuggested by EEI further masks specific delivery details and thus \\nprovides additional protection against public disclosure of identities, \\nbusiness transactions, and market positions of swap market \\nparticipants, as recommended by Barclays and Spring Trading.\\n    The Commission also considered the alternative of having DCMs and \\nSEFs set cap sizes. The Commission ultimately chose to determine cap \\nsizes itself for the reason that doing so limits the direct burden on \\nregistered entities to determine and implement appropriate cap sizes \\nthemselves. As such, the chosen approach will promote market efficiency \\nfor market participants and registered entities.\\n6. Application of the Section 15(a) Factors to the Amendments to Sec.  \\n43.4\\na. Protection of Market Participants and the Public\\n    The amendments to Sec.  43.4 protect swap counterparty anonymity on \\nan ongoing basis. While cap sizes for some transactions can exceed \\nappropriate minimum block sizes in certain circumstances (resulting in \\nthe public dissemination of notional/principal-amount information after \\na time delay), the Commission believes that for the vast majority of \\nimpacted swap transactions, the cap-size process and methodology is \\nsufficient to distinguish correctly between those for which masking of \\nnotional or principal amount is required to maintain anonymity and \\nthose for which it is not.\\\\683\\\\ The Commission believes that setting \\npost-initial cap sizes above appropriate minimum block sizes will \\nprovide additional pricing information with respect to large swap \\ntransactions, which are large enough to be treated as block trades (or \\nlarge notional off-facility swaps), but small enough that they do not \\nexceed the applicable post-\\n\\n[[Page 32931]]\\n\\ninitial cap size. This additional information may enhance price \\ndiscovery by publicly disseminating more information relating to market \\ndepth and the notional sizes of publicly reportable swap transactions, \\nwhile still protecting the anonymity of swap counterparties and their \\nability to lay off risk when executing extraordinarily large swap \\ntransactions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\683\\\\ The Commission recognizes that adoption of rules that \\ndelineate cap sizes insufficient to provide anonymity could cause \\nprospective counterparties to forego swap transactions, thus \\nadversely impacting market liquidity.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb. Efficiency, Competitiveness and Financial Integrity \\\\684\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\684\\\\ Although by its terms, section 15(a)(2)(B) applies to \\nfutures and not swaps, the Commission finds this factor useful in \\nanalyzing the costs and benefits of swaps regulation, as well. 7 \\nU.S.C. 19(a)(2)(B).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that amendments to Sec.  43.4(h) promote \\nmarket efficiencies and competitiveness since the approach will provide \\nmarket participants with the ability to continue transacting swaps with \\nthe protection of anonymity, while promoting greater price \\ntransparency.\\n    The Commission does not believe that the implementation of the \\nanonymity protections established in Sec.  43.4(h) will adversely \\nimpact the financial integrity of swap markets. The Commission has \\nconsidered the comments provided regarding impacts on liquidity arising \\nout of the 75 percent notional cap size. The Commission does not agree \\nthat the cap size will have a substantial negative impact on market \\nliquidity. As stated above, the additional pricing information \\navailable to the market as a result of the 75 percent notional cap size \\npromotes enhanced price discovery by publicly disseminating more \\ninformation relating to market depth and the notional sizes of publicly \\nreportable swap transactions, while still protecting the anonymity of \\nswap counterparties and their ability to lay off risk when executing \\nextraordinarily large swap transactions. This, in turn, promotes market \\nliquidity.\\nc. Price Discovery\\n    The cap size amendments to Sec.  43.4(h) should benefit market \\nparticipants, registered entities and the general public by providing \\ngreater price transparency with respect to swaps with notional amounts \\nthat fall between the post-initial appropriate minimum block size and \\npost-initial cap size for a particular swap category. During the post-\\ninitial period, the Commission will set appropriate minimum block sizes \\nbased on the 67 percent notional amount calculation \\\\685\\\\ and cap sizes \\nbased on the 75-percent notional amount calculation.\\\\686\\\\ Although \\nswaps with notional amounts that fall between these two sizes will be \\nsubject to a time delay, the exact notional amounts of these swaps will \\nbe publicly disclosed after the established time delay for blocks and \\nlarge notional off-facility swaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\685\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(1).\\n    \\\\686\\\\ See proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(2).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The masking provisions in the amendment to Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and \\nappendix D to part 43 further benefit market participants, registered \\nentities and the general public by enhancing price discovery with \\nrespect to swaps that currently are not required to be publicly \\ndisclosed under part 43. The amendment creating new Sec.  \\n43.4(d)(4)(iii) will require the public dissemination of data on these \\nswaps. The Commission expects that the real-time public reporting of \\nthese swaps will enhance price discovery in the other commodity asset \\nclass.\\nd. Sound Risk Management Practices\\n    To the extent that the amendments to Sec.  43.4 mask the identity, \\nbusiness transactions and market positions of swap counterparties, the \\nCommission expects that the amendments to Sec.  43.4 provide those \\ntraders with the anonymity and time delay they require to manage their \\nmarket risk efficiently.\\ne. Other Public Interest Considerations\\n    The Commission does not anticipate that the amendment to Sec.  \\n43.4(h) will have a material effect on public interest considerations \\nother than those identified above.\\n\\nF. Costs and Benefits Relevant to Sec.  43.6(h)(6)--Aggregation\\n\\n    Section 43.6(h)(6) specifies that, except as otherwise provided, it \\nis impermissible to aggregate orders for different accounts in order to \\nsatisfy minimum block trade or cap size requirements. The rule further \\nprovides that aggregation may be permitted on a DCM or SEF if done by a \\nperson who: (i)(A) is a CTA who is registered pursuant to Section 4n of \\nthe Act or is exempt from registration under the Act, or a principal \\nthereof, and has discretionary trading authority or directs client \\naccounts, (B) is an investment adviser who has discretionary trading \\nauthority or directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria of \\nSec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of the Commission\\'s regulations, or (C) is a foreign \\nperson who performs a role or function similar to the persons described \\nin (A) or (B) and is subject as such to foreign regulation, and (ii) \\nhas more than $25,000,000 in total AUM.\\n1. Overview of Comments Received\\n    The Commission received a number of comments with the proposed \\naggregation rule but none directly addressing the costs and benefits \\nconsiderations of the rule.\\n    JP Morgan commented that the rule appears to reflect a concern that \\nprivate negotiation affords less protection to unsophisticated \\ninvestors than trading through the central markets, and that since all \\nentities that transact in the OTC market already must be ECPs, the \\nanalogous concern about customer protection in the swaps market is \\nalready addressed.\\\\687\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\687\\\\ CL-JPM at 9, n.13.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ICI opposed the minimum assets under management requirement in \\nproposed Sec.  43.6(h)(6)(ii) and argued that the Commission did not \\narticulate a rationale or policy reason for this requirement.\\\\688\\\\ ICI \\nalso disagreed that an investment adviser seeking to aggregate orders \\nmust satisfy the criteria of Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations.\\\\689\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\688\\\\ CL-ICI at 3.\\n    \\\\689\\\\ Id. at 4. An investment adviser satisfies the criteria of \\nSec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) if the investment adviser registers pursuant to \\nSec.  203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or pursuant to the \\nlaws of any state, and the investment adviser has been registered \\nand active for two years or provides security investment advice to \\nsecurities accounts which, in the aggregate, have total assets in \\nexcess of $5,000,000 deposited at one or more registered securities \\nbrokers. 17 CFR 4.7(a)(2)(v).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    With respect to JP Morgan\\'s comment, the Commission notes that \\ncustomers trading swaps on DCMs do not have to be ECPs. As discussed \\nfurther below, adopted Sec.  43.6(i)(1) allows non-ECP customers to be \\nparties to block trades through a qualifying CTA, investment adviser, \\nor similar foreign person.\\\\690\\\\ It is possible, therefore, that those \\nnon-ECP DCM customers may not be aware if they received the best terms \\nfor their individual swap transactions that are aggregated with other \\ntransactions. Protection for such customers is therefore necessary, as \\nit is for unsophisticated customers in other markets.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\690\\\\ See infra Section II.C.6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In response to ICI\\'s opposition to the minimum asset threshold \\nunder Sec.  43.6(h)(6)(ii), the Commission notes that this threshold \\nreflects common industry practice.\\\\691\\\\ CME, for example, has enforced \\nthe $25 million threshold\\n\\n[[Page 32932]]\\n\\nin its rules since September 2000.\\\\692\\\\ CME has stated that the \\nthreshold ``is an effort to establish the professionalism and \\nsophistication of the registrant\\'\\' \\\\693\\\\ while also expanding the \\nnumber of CTAs and investment advisers eligible to aggregate \\ntrades.\\\\694\\\\ The Commission believes that the $25 million threshold is \\nan appropriate requirement to ensure that persons allowed to aggregate \\ntrades are appropriately sophisticated with these transactions, while \\nat the same time not excluding an unreasonable number of CTAs, \\ninvestment advisers, and similar foreign persons.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\691\\\\ See, e.g., CME Rule 526.

CME also stated in the filing that it \\nplanned to readdress the threshold amount as it gained experience \\nwith block trades, but has declined to modify the amount.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission also disagrees with ICI\\'s contention that investment \\nadvisers should not be required to satisfy the criteria under Sec.  \\n4.7(a)(2)(v), which requires an investment adviser to (1) be registered \\nand active as an investment adviser for two years or (2) provide \\nsecurities investment advice to securities accounts which, in the \\naggregate, have total assets in excess of $5 million deposited at one \\nor more registered securities brokers.\\\\695\\\\ The Commission first \\nadopted provisions similar to current Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) in 1992 \\\\696\\\\ \\nas objective indications that a person had the investment \\nsophistication and experience needed to evaluate the risks and benefits \\nof investing in commodity pools or a portfolio large enough to indicate \\nthe same, along with the financial resources to withstand the \\ninvestment risks.\\\\697\\\\ In 2000,\\\\698\\\\ the Commission extended the same \\ncriteria in current Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) to registered investment \\nadvisers for the same reasons.\\\\699\\\\ The Commission believes that these \\nobjective criteria, which demonstrate that an investment adviser \\npossesses the necessary investment expertise, should also apply with \\nrespect to allowing such persons to aggregate client orders.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\695\\\\ 17 CFR 4.7(a)(2)(v).\\n    \\\\696\\\\ 57 FR 34853, 34854-55 (Aug. 7, 1992). The final rule \\nreduced the amount on deposit threshold to $5 million from the $10 \\nmillion required by the proposed rule. See 57 FR 3148, 3152 (Jan. \\n28, 1992).\\n    \\\\697\\\\ See 57 FR at 34854 (quoting 57 FR at 3152).\\n    \\\\698\\\\ 65 FR 11253, 11257-58 (Mar. 2, 2000).\\n    \\\\699\\\\ Id. at 11257 (quoting 57 FR at 3152).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that the $25 million threshold, as well as \\nrequiring investment advisers to satisfy the criteria under Sec.  \\n4.7(a)(2)(v), are both important for certifying that persons allowed to \\naggregate trades are appropriately sophisticated and important for \\nprotection of market participants and public.\\n2. Costs\\n    The Commission expects that there will be some incremental cost \\nattendant to compliance with Sec.  43.6(h)(6). The Commission believes \\nthat the overall benefits to the market of allowing for the aggregation \\nof orders under certain circumstances (i.e., if done on a designated \\ncontract market or a swap execution facility by certain CTAs, \\ninvestment advisers or foreign persons) will mitigate costs of reduced \\nmarket liquidity that could result from execution of such transactions \\naway from the centralized marketplace. The Commission also expects \\nthere to be some advisors who will be prohibited from aggregating \\norders for different trading accounts in order to satisfy the minimum \\nblock size, or cap size requirements. The Commission also believes that \\nas a result of some advisers not being allowed to aggregate, there \\nmight be some minimal unquantifiable cost associated with a decrease in \\ncompetition among such traders in the market.\\n3. Benefits\\n    The rule is designed, in large part, to prevent circumvention of \\nthe exchange trading requirements and of the real-time reporting \\nobligations associated with non-block transactions. Absent this \\nprohibition, the goals of the Commission\\'s regulations regarding block \\ntrading, namely increased transaction transparency, better price \\ndiscovery and improved competitiveness in the markets as well as better \\nrisk management, could be frustrated by those whose trades individually \\nfail to meet the minimum block trade threshold (and cap size threshold \\nas a result), but nevertheless achieve the benefits intended for \\nextraordinarily large positions by aggregating those individual trades. \\nIn other words, such entities would be able to evade the exchange-\\ntrading and reporting obligations that are integral to price \\ntransparency.\\n4. Section 15(a) Factors\\na. Protection of Market Participants and the Public\\n    The Commission believes that the rule will protect market \\nparticipants from unfair practices by preventing trades that do not \\nmeet the minimum block trade threshold from enjoying extended reporting \\ntimes. This means that trades that are not extraordinarily large, and \\nhence, that do not need extra reporting time will not qualify as block \\ntrades and will be made public as soon as technologically practicable. \\nHence, the rule will increase transparency of non-block transactions, \\nand thus, would protect market participants by informing their trading \\ndeterminations through increased transparency and price discovery.\\nb. Efficiency, Competitiveness, and Financial Integrity of the Futures \\nMarkets\\n    The Commission expects the prohibition of aggregation of trades to \\nimprove efficiency and competitiveness in the markets by allowing more \\ntrades to be reported without the time delay that is applied to \\nqualifying block trades. This means that a higher number of trades will \\nbe eligible for real time reporting, and that will increase market \\ntransparency as well as promote competition in the swap markets. The \\nrule also will protect the integrity of the derivatives market by \\nensuring that smaller trades, which do not qualify as block \\ntransactions, are executed on the trading system where there is pre-\\ntrade and post-trade transparency.\\n    The Commission also recognizes that advisors who are prohibited \\nfrom aggregating orders in order to satisfy the minimum block size or \\ncap size requirements might not trade at the most favorable prices in \\nthe market, which might have a negative effect on the number of such \\ntraders in the market. While the Commission expects that competition in \\nthe market may be negatively affected as a result of prohibiting \\naggregation, the Commission anticipates that the positive effects of \\nthe rule on competition outweigh its negative effects.\\nc. Price Discovery\\n    The Commission expects the rule to improve price discovery in the \\nswap markets by preventing aggregation of trades and as a result \\npromoting more trades to be publicly reported as soon as \\ntechnologically practicable. This will result in enhanced swap market \\nprice discovery, since market participants and the public will be able \\nto observe real-time pricing information for a higher\\n\\n[[Page 32933]]\\n\\npercentage of transactions in the market. In addition, the Commission \\nexpects that the rule will enhance price discovery by ensuring that \\nsmaller trades, which do not qualify as block transactions, are \\nexecuted on the trading system where there is pre-trade and post-trade \\ntransparency and where buyers and sellers may make informed trading \\ndecisions based on the market\\'s transparency.\\nd. Sound Risk Management Practices\\n    The Commission anticipates that the criteria will likely result in \\nenhanced price discovery as discussed above. With better and more \\naccurate data, swap market participants will likely be better able to \\nmeasure and manage risk. The Commission believes that if the \\nprohibition of aggregation of trades was not adopted, swap transactions \\nmay not be reported to an SDR ``as soon as technologically \\npracticable.\\'\\' The Commission also believes that by preventing this \\ndelay in the reporting period of a swap transaction to an SDR, the \\nCommission will possess the information it needs to monitor the \\ntransfer and positions of risk among counterparties in the swaps \\nmarket.\\ne. Other Public Interest Considerations\\n    The Commission has not identified any other public interest \\nconsiderations regarding the rule.\\n\\nG. Costs and Benefits Relevant to Sec.  43.6(i)--Eligible Block Trade \\nParties\\n\\n1. Overview of Comments Received\\n    The Commission received few comments with respect to the eligible \\nblock trade parties rule. As discussed above, similar comments \\nregarding the exceptions to the prohibitions against aggregation for \\ncertain persons were submitted with respect to the exception to certain \\npersons transacting blocks on a DCM on behalf of non-ECPs. For example, \\nICI opposed the minimum assets under management requirement in proposed \\nSec.  43.6(i)(1) and similarly argued that the Commission did not \\narticulate a rationale or policy reason for this requirement.\\\\700\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\700\\\\ CL-ICI at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received one specific comment related to costs on \\nproposed Sec.  43.6(i)(2). SIFMA commented that proposed Sec.  \\n43.6(i)(2) may require asset managers to obtain consent from each \\nclient for whom they will engage in block trades.\\\\701\\\\ SIFMA contended \\nthat this requirement would be costly and unnecessary, and that notice \\nto the customers \\\\702\\\\ or a general grant of investment discretion in \\nthe investment management agreement, power of attorney, or similar \\ndocument should be sufficient.\\\\703\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\701\\\\ CL-SIFMA at 1.\\n    \\\\702\\\\ Id. at 2.\\n    \\\\703\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission disagrees with SIFMA\\'s contention regarding the \\nburdens of obtaining consent. This burden consent will be minimal \\nbecause Sec.  43.6(i)(2) states that the instruction or consent may be \\nprovided through a power of attorney or similar document that provides \\ndiscretionary trading authority or the authority to direct trading in \\nthe account. The consent may therefore be included in existing and \\nfuture customer agreements. The Commission further disagrees that a \\ngeneral grant of investment discretion or notice to the customer should \\nsatisfy Sec.  43.6(i)(2). A customer\\'s written instruction or consent \\nis necessary because a customer potentially may not receive the best \\nterms for an individual swap transaction that is part of an \\naggregation. The written instruction or consent makes the customer \\naware that block trades may be used on its behalf, allowing the \\ncustomer to decide whether to allow these transactions, through which \\nthe rule has the added benefit of protection of market participants and \\npublic. The Commission also would like to point out that a cost \\nestimate for that burden has already been presented in the proposed \\nrule and received no direct comments on that cost estimate.\\n2. Costs\\n    Section 43.6(i)(1) requires that parties to a block trade must be \\neligible contract participants, as defined under the CEA and Commission \\nregulations, except that a DCM may allow: (i) A CTA registered pursuant \\nto Section 4n of the Act or exempt from registration under the Act, or \\na principal thereof, and who has discretionary trading authority or \\ndirects client accounts, (ii) an investment adviser who has \\ndiscretionary trading authority or directs client accounts and \\nsatisfies the criteria of Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of the Commission\\'s \\nregulations, or (iii) a foreign person who performs a similar role or \\nfunction to the persons described in (i) or (ii) and is subject as such \\nto foreign regulation, to transact block trades for customers who are \\nnot eligible contract participants, if such CTA, investment adviser or \\nforeign person has more than $25,000,000 in total AUM. This rule \\ncodifies, in part, the requirement under Section 2(e) of the CEA, which \\nrequires that ``[i]t shall be unlawful for any person, other than an \\neligible contract participant, to enter into a swap unless the swap is \\nentered into on, or subject to the rules of[hellip].a designated \\ncontract market.\\'\\' In addition, the provisions allowing certain \\nentities (as described in this release) to enter into block trades on \\nbehalf of their non-ECP customers on DCMs is substantially similar to \\nthe existing DCM rules that allow block trading in the futures market.\\n    Section 43.6(i)(2) further provides that no person may conduct a \\nblock trade on behalf of a customer unless the person receives prior \\nwritten instruction or consent to do so. The rule further provides that \\nsuch instruction or consent may be provided in the power of attorney or \\nsimilar document by which the customer provides the person with \\ndiscretionary trading authority or the authority to direct the trading \\nin its account. The Commission is of the view that the cost associated \\nwith the written instruction or consent is minimal. The Commission \\nestimates that a prior written instruction or consent requirement would \\nimpose an initial non-recurring burden of approximately 2 personnel \\nhours at an approximate cost of $155.54 for each CTA, investment \\nadviser or foreign person.\\\\704\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\704\\\\ The estimate is calculated as follows: Compliance manager \\nat 2 hours. A compliance manager\\'s adjusted hourly wage is $77.77. \\nSee note 521 supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Benefits\\n    The Commission has determined that the benefits of Sec.  43.6(i) \\nare significant. The rule allows customers who are not ECPs to engage \\nin block trade transactions through certain entities as outlined in the \\nrule. By permitting certain CTAs, investment advisers and foreign \\npersons to transact swaps on behalf of non-ECP customers, the rule \\nprovides important safeguards for non-ECPs when entering into block \\ntransactions in swaps. The Commission believes that access to block \\ntrades will allow customers who are not ECPs to diversify their risk or \\nimprove their investment strategies. In addition, the Commission also \\nanticipates the access to block trades for non-ECPs to increase their \\nparticipation in swap markets, increasing liquidity in the markets for \\neveryone.\\n    The Commission acknowledges that Sec.  43.6(i)(2) has the added \\nbenefit of protection of market participants and public since the \\nwritten instruction or consent required in Sec.  43.6(i)(2) of the rule \\nmakes the customer aware that block trades may be used on its behalf, \\nallowing the customer to decide whether to allow these transactions.\\n\\n[[Page 32934]]\\n\\n4. Section 15(a) Factors\\na. Protection of Market Participants and the Public\\n    As discussed above, Sec.  43.6(i)(2), by requiring that no person \\nmay conduct a block trade on behalf of a customer unless the person \\nreceives prior written instruction or consent to do so, protects the \\ncustomer by making sure the customer is aware that block trades may be \\nused on its behalf. This means better protection for market \\nparticipants and the public since no one will be able to conduct a \\nblock trade on their behalf without their consent.\\nb. Efficiency, Competitiveness, and Financial Integrity of the Futures \\nMarkets\\n    The Commission expects the rule to improve competitiveness in the \\nmarkets by allowing customers who are not ECPs to have access to block \\ntrades through certain CTAs, investment advisers and foreign persons. \\nThe Commission anticipates an increase in competitiveness due to the \\nfact that more customers would use the swap markets as a result of this \\nrule. An increased participation in a market will also serve to \\nincrease liquidity, as well as competition, in that market.\\nc. Price Discovery\\n    The Commission does not anticipate the rule to have any significant \\neffect on price discovery in the market.\\nd. Sound Risk Management Practices\\n    The Commission does not anticipate the rule to have any significant \\neffect on risk management practices.\\ne. Other Public Interest Considerations\\n    The Commission has not identified any other public interest \\nconsiderations regarding the rule.\\n\\nVI. Regulatory Flexibility Act\\n\\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA\\'\\') requires Federal agencies \\nto consider the impact of its rules on ``small entities.\\'\\' \\\\705\\\\ A \\nregulatory flexibility analysis or certification typically is required \\nfor ``any rule for which the agency publishes a general notice of \\nproposed rulemaking pursuant to\\'\\' the notice-and-comment provisions of \\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b).\\\\706\\\\ With respect to \\nthe Further Block Proposal, the Commission provided in its RFA \\nstatement that the proposed rule would have a direct effect on a number \\nof entities, specifically DCMs, SEFs, SDs, MSPs, and certain single \\nend-users.\\\\707\\\\ In the Further Block Proposal, the Chairman, on behalf \\nof the Commission, certified that the rulemaking would not have a \\nsignificant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. \\nComments on that certification were sought.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\705\\\\ See 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\\n    \\\\706\\\\ See 5 U.S.C. 601(2), 603, 604, and 605.\\n    \\\\707\\\\ As discussed more fully in the Further Block Proposal, the \\nCommission is of the view that registered entities such as SDs and \\nMSPs are not small businesses.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission provided that it \\npreviously had established that certain entities subject to its \\njurisdiction are not small entities for purposes of the RFA. \\nSpecifically, the Commission stated that it had previously determined \\nthat SEFs and DCMs are not small businesses.\\\\708\\\\ The Commission also \\nstated that it is of the view that SDs and MSPs are not small \\nbusinesses.\\\\709\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\708\\\\ 77 FR at 15499. See 17 CFR part 40 Provisions Common to \\nRegistered Entities, 75 FR 67282 (Nov. 2, 2010); see also 47 FR \\n18618, 18619, Apr. 30, 1982 and 66 FR 45604, 45609, Aug. 29, 2001.\\n    \\\\709\\\\ 77 FR at 15499.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission recognized that the proposed rule could impose \\ndirect burdens on parties to a swap, which the Commission has \\ndetermined previously may include a percentage of small end users that \\nare considered small businesses for the purposes of the RFA.\\\\710\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\710\\\\ See 77 FR 1240 (``[T]he Commission recognized that the \\nproposed rule could have an economic effect on certain single end \\nusers, in particular those end users that enter into swap \\ntransactions with another end-user. Unlike the other parties to \\nwhich the proposed rulemaking would apply, these end users are not \\nsubject to designation or registration with or to comprehensive \\nregulation by the Commission. The Commission recognized that some of \\nthese end users may be small entities.\\'\\'). The term reporting party \\nalso includes swap dealers and major swap participants.\\n    The Commission previously has determined that these entities do \\nfall within the definition of small business for the purpose of the \\nRFA. See 75 FR at 76170.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Notwithstanding the imposition of this burden, however, the \\ndetermination to certify pursuant to Sec.  605(b) of the RFA that the \\nproposed rule would not have a significant economic effect on a \\nsubstantial number of small entities was based upon two major \\nconsiderations. First, Section 43.3 of the Commission\\'s regulations \\nalready requires these entities to report their swap transaction and \\npricing data to an SDR.\\\\711\\\\ The Commission is of the view that \\nrequiring these entities to include an additional notification or field \\nin conjunction with the reporting of such data would impose, at best, a \\nmarginal and incremental cost. Second, the proposed rule was structured \\nso that most swaps that are expected to be executed by an end user \\nwould not require notification of the election by the end user, but \\nrather by a party that is subject to Commission registration and \\nregulation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\711\\\\ See 77 FR 1240.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission did not receive any comments respecting its RFA \\ncertification. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the Further \\nProposal and set forth above, the Commission continues to believe that \\nthe rulemaking will not have a significant impact on a substantial \\nnumber of small entities. Therefore, the Chairman, on behalf of the \\nCommission, hereby certifies, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the \\nprocedure to establish appropriate minimum block sizes adopted herein \\nwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \\nsmall entities.\\n\\nVII. Example of a Post-initial Appropriate Minimum Block Size \\nDetermination Using the 67-percent Notional Amount Calculation\\n\\n    The example below describes the steps necessary for the Commission \\nto determine the post-initial appropriate minimum block size based on \\nSec.  43.6(c)(1) for a sample set of data in ``Swap Category Z.\\'\\' For \\nthe purposes of this example, Swap Category Z had 35 transactions over \\nthe given observation period.

not fall within the \\ndefinition of ``publicly reportable swap transactions\\'\\' as described in \\nSec.  43.2.\\n    In this example, assume that five of the 35 transactions in Swap \\nCategory Z do not fall within the definition of ``publicly reportable \\nswap transaction.\\'\\' These five transactions, listed in table B below \\nwould be removed for the data set that will be used to determine the \\npost-initial appropriate minimum block size.\\n\\n    Table B--Transactions That Do Not Fall Within the Definition of ``Publicly Reportable Swap Transaction\\'\\'\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Transaction <greek-    Transaction <greek-    Transaction

50,000,000             75,000,000\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Step 2A: Convert the publicly reportable swap transactions in the \\nswap category to the same currency or units.\\n    In order to accurately compare the transactions in a swap category \\nand apply the appropriate minimum block size calculation, the \\ntransactions must be converted to the same currency or unit.\\n    In this example, the publicly reportable swap transactions were all \\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, so no conversion was necessary. If the \\nnotional amounts of any of the publicly reportable swap transactions in \\nSwap Category Z had been denominated in a currency other than U.S. \\ndollars, then the notional amounts of such publicly reportable swap \\ntransactions would have been adjusted by the daily exchange rates for \\nthe period to arrive at the U.S. dollars equivalent notional amount.\\n    Step 2B: Examine the remaining data set for any outliers and remove \\nany such outliers, resulting in a trimmed data set.\\n    The publicly reportable swap transactions are examined to identify \\nany outliers. If an outlier is discovered, then it would be removed \\nfrom the data set. To conduct this analysis, the notional amounts of \\nall of the publicly reportable swap transactions remaining after step 1 \\nand step 2A are transformed by Log<INF>10</INF>. The average and \\nstandard deviation (``STDEV\\'\\') of these transformed notional amounts \\nwould then be calculated. Any transformed notional amount of a publicly \\nreportable swap transaction that is larger than the average of all \\ntransformed notional amounts plus four times the standard deviation \\nwould be omitted from the data set as an outlier.\\n    In the data set used in this example, none of the observations were \\nlarge enough to qualify as an outlier, as shown in the calculations \\ndescribed in Table C.\\n\\n               Table C--Testing for Outliers in the Publicly Reportable Swap Transaction Data Set\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLog10 Average...............................              7.75  4*STDEV+Average...............              10.2\\nLog10 STDEV.................................          0.611359  Omitted Values................

In this example, the notional amounts of the \\n30 remaining publicly reportable swap transactions in Swap Category Z \\nare added together to come up with a net value of 2,989,706,421.\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31MY13.000\\n\\n30 = Notional amount of swap transaction\\ni = Index variable of summation for the set\\nTi = Indicator for publicly reportable swap transactions\\nPRSTNV = Sum total of the notional amounts of all remaining publicly \\nreportable swap transactions in the set\\n\\nPRSTNV = 2,989,706,421\\n\\n    Step 4: Calculate the 67 Percent Notional Amount.\\n    Using the resulting amount from step 2B, a 67-percent notional \\namount value would be calculated by using the equation:\\n\\nPRST<INF>NV</INF> * 0.67 = G\\n\\nG = 67 percent of the sum total of the notional amounts of all \\nremaining publicly reportable swap transactions in the set.\\n\\nG = 2,003,103,302\\n\\n    Step 5: Order and rank the observations based on notional amount of \\nthe publicly reportable swap transaction from least to greatest.\\n    The remaining publicly reportable swap transactions having \\npreviously been converted to U.S. dollar equivalents must be ranked, \\nbased on the notional sizes of such transactions, from least to \\ngreatest. The resulting ranking yields the PRSTi[squ].

Swap contracts in the other \\ncommodity asset class shall be grouped into swap categories as follows:\\n    (i) For swaps that are economically related to contracts in \\nAppendix B of this part, by the relevant contract as referenced in \\nAppendix B of this part; or\\n    (ii) For swaps that are not economically related to contracts in \\nAppendix B of this part, by the following futures-related swaps--\\n    (A) CME Cheese;\\n    (B) CBOT Distillers\\' Dried Grain;\\n    (C) CBOT Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index;\\n    (D) CBOT Ethanol;\\n    (E) CME Frost Index;\\n    (F) CME Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI), (GSCI Excess Return \\nIndex);\\n    (G) NYMEX Gulf Coast Sour Crude Oil;\\n    (H) CME Hurricane Index;\\n    (I) CME Rainfall Index;\\n    (J) CME Snowfall Index;\\n    (K) CME Temperature Index;\\n    (L) CME U.S. Dollar Cash Settled Crude Palm Oil; or\\n    (iii) For swaps that are not covered in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and \\n(b)(5)(ii) of this section, the relevant product type as referenced in \\nAppendix D of this part.\\n\\n[[Page 32939]]\\n\\n    (c) Methodologies to determine appropriate minimum block sizes and \\ncap sizes. In determining appropriate minimum block sizes and cap sizes \\nfor publicly reportable swap transactions, the Commission shall utilize \\nthe following statistical calculations--\\n    (1) 50-percent notional amount calculation. The Commission shall \\nuse the following procedure in determining the 50-percent notional \\namount calculation:\\n    (i) Select all of the publicly reportable swap transactions within \\na specific swap category using a one-year window of data beginning with \\na minimum of one year\\'s worth of data;\\n    (ii) Convert to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data \\nset;\\n    (iii) Determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the \\ntrimmed data set;\\n    (iv) Multiply the sum of the notional amount by 50 percent;\\n    (v) Rank order the observations by notional amount from least to \\ngreatest;\\n    (vi) Calculate the cumulative sum of the observations until the \\ncumulative sum is equal to or greater than the 50-percent notional \\namount calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section;\\n    (vii) Select the notional amount associated with that observation;\\n    (viii) Round the notional amount of that observation to two \\nsignificant digits, or if the notional amount associated with that \\nobservation is already significant to two digits, increase that \\nnotional amount to the next highest rounding point of two significant \\ndigits; and\\n    (ix) Set the appropriate minimum block size at the amount \\ncalculated in paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section.\\n    (2) 67-percent notional amount calculation. The Commission shall \\nuse the following procedure in determining the 67-percent notional \\namount calculation:\\n    (i) Select all of the publicly reportable swap transactions within \\na specific swap category using a one-year window of data beginning with \\na minimum of one year\\'s worth of data;\\n    (ii) Convert to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data \\nset;\\n    (iii) Determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the \\ntrimmed data set;\\n    (iv) Multiply the sum of the notional amount by 67 percent;\\n    (v) Rank order the observations by notional amount from least to \\ngreatest;\\n    (vi) Calculate the cumulative sum of the observations until the \\ncumulative sum is equal to or greater than the 67-percent notional \\namount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section;\\n    (vii) Select the notional amount associated with that observation;\\n    (viii) Round the notional amount of that observation to two \\nsignificant digits, or if the notional amount associated with that \\nobservation is already significant to two digits, increase that \\nnotional amount to the next highest rounding point of two significant \\ndigits; and\\n    (ix) Set the appropriate minimum block size at the amount \\ncalculated in paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section.\\n    (3) 75-percent notional amount calculation. The Commission shall \\nuse the following procedure in determining the 75-percent notional \\namount calculation:\\n    (i) Select all of the publicly reportable swap transactions within \\na specific swap category using a one-year window of data beginning with \\na minimum of one year\\'s worth of data;\\n    (ii) Convert to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data \\nset;\\n    (iii) Determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the \\ntrimmed data set;\\n    (iv) Multiply the sum of the notional amount by 75 percent;\\n    (v) Rank order the observations by notional amount from least to \\ngreatest;\\n    (vi) Calculate the cumulative sum of the observations until the \\ncumulative sum is equal to or greater than the 75-percent notional \\namount calculated in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section;\\n    (vii) Select the notional amount associated with that observation;\\n    (viii) Round the notional amount of that observation to two \\nsignificant digits, or if the notional amount associated with that \\nobservation is already significant to two digits, increase that \\nnotional amount to the next highest rounding point of two significant \\ndigits; and\\n    (ix) Set the appropriate minimum block size at the amount \\ncalculated in paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section.\\n    (d) No appropriate minimum block sizes for swaps in the equity \\nasset class. Publicly reportable swap transactions in the equity asset \\nclass shall not be treated as block trades or large notional off-\\nfacility swaps.\\n    (e) Initial appropriate minimum block sizes. Prior to the \\nCommission making a determination as described in paragraph (f)(1) of \\nthis section, the following initial appropriate minimum block sizes \\nshall apply:\\n    (1) Prescribed appropriate minimum block sizes. Except as otherwise \\nprovided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for any publicly \\nreportable swap transaction that falls within the swap categories \\ndescribed in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)(i), (b)(5)(i) or \\n(b)(5)(ii) of this section, the initial appropriate minimum block size \\nfor such publicly reportable swap transaction shall be the appropriate \\nminimum block size that is in Appendix F of this part.\\n    (2) Certain swaps in the foreign exchange and other commodity asset \\nclasses. All swaps or instruments in the swap categories described in \\nparagraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(5)(iii) of this section shall be eligible \\nto be treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, as \\napplicable.\\n    (3) Exception. Publicly reportable swap transactions described in \\nparagraph (b)(5)(i) of this section that are economically related to a \\nfutures contract in Appendix B of this part shall not qualify to be \\ntreated as block trades or large notional off-facility swaps (as \\napplicable), if such futures contract is not subject to a designated \\ncontract market\\'s block trading rules.\\n    (f) Post-initial process to determine appropriate minimum block \\nsizes.\\n    (1) Post-initial period. After a registered swap data repository \\nhas collected at least one year of reliable data for a particular asset \\nclass, the Commission shall establish, by swap categories, the post-\\ninitial appropriate minimum block sizes as described in paragraphs \\n(f)(2) through (f)(5) of this section. No less than once each calendar \\nyear thereafter, the Commission shall update the post-initial \\nappropriate minimum block sizes.\\n    (2) Post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes for certain swaps. \\nThe Commission shall determine post-initial appropriate minimum block \\nsizes for the swap categories described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), \\n(b)(4)(i) and (b)(5) of this section by utilizing a one-year window of \\nswap transaction and pricing data corresponding to each relevant swap \\ncategory reviewed no less than once each calendar year, and by applying \\nthe 67-percent notional amount calculation to such data.\\n    (3) Certain swaps in the foreign exchange asset class. All swaps or \\ninstruments in the swap category described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of \\nthis section shall be eligible to be treated as a block trade or large \\nnotional off-facility swap, as applicable.\\n    (4) Commission publication of post-initial appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes. The Commission shall publish the appropriate minimum block \\nsizes determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section on its \\nWeb site at <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov\">http://www.cftc.gov</a>.\\n    (5) Effective date of post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes. \\nUnless otherwise indicated on the Commission\\'s Web site, the post-\\ninitial appropriate minimum block sizes described in paragraph (f)(1) \\nof this\\n\\n[[Page 32940]]\\n\\nsection shall be effective on the first day of the second month \\nfollowing the date of publication.\\n    (g) Required notification.\\n    (1) Block trade election.\\n    (i) The parties to a publicly reportable swap transaction that has \\na notional amount at or above the appropriate minimum block size shall \\nnotify the registered swap execution facility or designated contract \\nmarket, as applicable, pursuant to the rules of such registered swap \\nexecution facility or designated contract market, of its election to \\nhave the publicly reportable swap transaction treated as a block trade.\\n    (ii) The registered swap execution facility or designated contract \\nmarket, as applicable, pursuant to the rules of which a block trade is \\nexecuted shall notify the registered swap data repository of such a \\nblock trade election when transmitting swap transaction and pricing \\ndata to such swap data repository in accordance with Sec.  43.3(b)(1).\\n    (2) Large notional off-facility swap election. A reporting party \\nwho executes an off-facility swap that has a notional amount at or \\nabove the appropriate minimum block size shall notify the applicable \\nregistered swap data repository that such swap transaction qualifies as \\na large notional off-facility swap concurrent with the transmission of \\nswap transaction and pricing data in accordance with this part.\\n    (h) Special provisions relating to appropriate minimum block sizes \\nand cap sizes. The following special rules shall apply to the \\ndetermination of appropriate minimum block sizes and cap sizes--\\n    (1) Swaps with optionality. The notional amount of a swap with \\noptionality shall equal the notional amount of the component of the \\nswap that does not include the option component.\\n    (2) Swaps with composite reference prices. The parties to a swap \\ntransaction with composite reference prices may elect to apply the \\nlowest appropriate minimum block size or cap size applicable to one \\ncomponent reference price\\'s swap category of such publicly reportable \\nswap transaction.\\n    (3) Notional amounts for physical commodity swaps. Unless otherwise \\nspecified in this part, the notional amount for a physical commodity \\nswap shall be based on the notional unit measure utilized in the \\nrelated futures contract market or the predominant notional unit \\nmeasure used to determine notional quantities in the cash market for \\nthe relevant, underlying physical commodity.\\n    (4) Currency conversion. Unless otherwise specified in this part, \\nwhen the appropriate minimum block size or cap size for a publicly \\nreportable swap transaction is denominated in a currency other than \\nU.S. dollars, parties to a swap and registered entities may use a \\ncurrency exchange rate that is widely published within the preceding \\ntwo business days from the date of execution of the swap transaction in \\norder to determine such qualification.\\n    (5) Successor currencies. For currencies that succeed a super-major \\ncurrency, the appropriate currency classification for such currency \\nshall be based on the corresponding nominal gross domestic product \\nclassification (in U.S. dollars) as determined in the most recent World \\nBank, World Development Indicator at the time of succession. If the \\ngross domestic product of the country or nation utilizing the successor \\ncurrency is:\\n    (i) Greater than $2 trillion, then the successor currency shall be \\nincluded among the super-major currencies;\\n    (ii) Greater than $500 billion but less than $2 trillion, then the \\nsuccessor currency shall be included among the major currencies; or\\n    (iii) Less than $500 billion, then the successor currency shall be \\nincluded among the non-major currencies.\\n    (6) Aggregation. Except as otherwise stated in this paragraph, the \\naggregation of orders for different accounts in order to satisfy the \\nminimum block trade size or the cap size requirement is prohibited. \\nAggregation is permissible on a designated contract market or swap \\nexecution facility if done by a person who:\\n    (i) (A) Is a commodity trading advisor registered pursuant to \\nSection 4n of the Act, or exempt from registration under the Act, or a \\nprincipal thereof, who has discretionary trading authority or directs \\nclient accounts,\\n    (B) Is an investment adviser who has discretionary trading \\nauthority or directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria of \\nSec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of this chapter, or\\n    (C) Is a foreign person who performs a similar role or function as \\nthe persons described in paragraphs (h)(6)(i)(A) or (h)(6)(i)(B) of \\nthis section and is subject as such to foreign regulation; and,\\n    (ii) Has more than $25,000,000 in total assets under management.\\n    (i) Eligible Block Trade Parties.\\n    (1) Parties to a block trade must be ``eligible contract \\nparticipants,\\'\\' as defined in Section 1a(18) of the Act and the \\nCommission\\'s regulations. However, a designated contract market may \\nallow:\\n    (i) A commodity trading advisor registered pursuant to Section 4n \\nof the Act, or exempt from registration under the Act, or a principal \\nthereof, who has discretionary trading authority or directs client \\naccounts,\\n    (ii) An investment adviser who has discretionary trading authority \\nor directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria of Sec.  \\n4.7(a)(2)(v) of this chapter, or\\n    (iii) a foreign person who performs a similar role or function as \\nthe persons described in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section \\nand is subject as such to foreign regulation, to transact block trades \\nfor customers who are not eligible contract participants if such \\ncommodity trading advisor, investment adviser or foreign person has \\nmore than $25,000,000 in total assets under management.\\n    (2) A person transacting a block trade on behalf of a customer must \\nreceive prior written instruction or consent from the customer to do \\nso. Such instruction or consent may be provided in the power of \\nattorney or similar document by which the customer provides the person \\nwith discretionary trading authority or the authority to direct the \\ntrading in its account.\\n\\n0\\n5. Add Sec.  43.7 to read as follows:\\n\\n\\nSec.  43.7  Delegation of authority.\\n\\n    (a) Authority. The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders \\notherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight or such \\nother employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to \\ntime, the authority:\\n    (1) To determine whether swaps fall within specific swap categories \\nas described in Sec.  43.6(b);\\n    (2) To determine and publish post-initial, appropriate minimum \\nblock sizes as described in Sec.  43.6(f); and\\n    (3) To determine post-initial cap sizes as described in Sec.  \\n43.4(h).\\n    (b) Submission for Commission consideration.

Kirkpatrick,\\nDeputy Secretary of the Commission.\\n\\nAppendices to Procedures To Establish Appropriate Minimum Block Sizes \\nfor Large Notional Off-Facility Swaps and Block Trades--Commission \\nVoting Summary and Statements of Commissioners\\n\\n    Note:  The following appendices will not appear in the Code of \\nFederal Regulations.\\n\\nAppendix 1--Commission Voting Summary\\n\\nOn this matter, Chairman Gensler and Commissioners Chilton and \\nWetjen voted in the affirmative; Commissioners Sommers and O\\'Malia \\nvoted in the negative.\\n\\nAppendix 2--Statement of Chairman Gary Gensler\\n\\n    I support the final block rule for swaps, which is critical to \\npromoting transparency in this once opaque market. With this rule, \\nthe public will benefit from seeing the price and volume of the \\nmajority of swaps transactions in real time--as soon as \\ntechnologically practicable--after a trade is executed. Further, \\nwith this rule the public will benefit from the competition that \\nwill arise as buyers and sellers must transact on transparent \\ntrading platforms.\\n    The methodology for determining block sizes is appropriately \\ntailored to vary by asset class and by underlying referenced product \\nor rate.\\n    The Commission also has established a phased-in approach for \\nsetting and implementing appropriate minimum block sizes. During an \\ninitial one-year period, block sizes in the interest rate and credit \\nasset classes will be set such that 50 percent of the notional \\namount of a particular swap category will benefit from pre-trade and \\npost-trade transparency. Also during this initial period, the block \\nsizes for foreign exchange and other commodity asset classes will be \\nbased upon the block sizes that designated contract markets have set \\nfor economically related futures contracts.\\n    After the initial period, the Commission will determine block \\nsizes using a methodology that relies on the data collected by swap \\ndata repositories. Block sizes will be set such that 67 percent of \\nthe notional amount of a particular swap category will benefit from \\npre-trade transparency and enhanced post-trade transparency.\\n    The rule also includes measures to protect the identities, \\nmarket positions and business transactions of swap counterparties \\nwhen their swap transactions and pricing are reported to the public.\\n\\n[FR Doc. 2013-12133 Filed 5-30-13; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 6351-01-P\\n\\n\\n</pre></body>\\n</html>'"

      " ~~# index: 7||     The second statutory requirement relevant to this final rule is found in sections 2(a)(13)(E)(i) and 2(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the CEA. Through these sections, Congress sought to ``ensure that the public reporting of swap transaction and pricing data [would] not disclose the names or identities of the parties to [swap] transactions.'' \\8\n",
      " ~~# index: 8|| Accordingly, Sec.  2(a)(13)(E)(i) of the CEA requires the Commission to protect the identities of counterparties to mandatorily-cleared swaps, swaps excepted from the mandatory clearing requirement, and voluntarily-cleared swaps.

      " ~~# index: 9|| Final Rule, however, did not adopt most of the provisions in the Initial Proposal pertaining to appropriate block sizes and anonymity.

      " ~~# index: 11|| In this Initial Proposal, the Commission set out proposed provisions to satisfy, among other things, the statutory requirements discussed above regarding minimum block sizes and anonymity protections. With respect to the first statutory requirement, the Commission proposed: (1) Definitions for the terms ``large notional off-facility swap'' and ``block trade''; \\12\n",
      " ~~# index: 12|| (2) a method for determining the appropriate minimum block sizes for large notional off-facility swaps and block trades; \\13\n",
      " ~~# index: 13|| and (3) a framework for timely reporting of such transactions and trades.\\14\n",
      " ~~# index: 14|| Proposed Sec.  43.5(g) provided that registered swap data repositories (``SDRs'') would be responsible for calculating the appropriate minimum block size for each ``swap instrument'' using the greater result of the distribution test \\15\n",

      " ~~# index: 16|| Proposed Sec.  43.2(y) broadly defined ``swap instrument'' as ``a grouping of swaps in the same asset class with the same or similar characteristics.''\\17\n",
      " ~~# index: 17|| Proposed Sec.  43.5(h) provided that for any swap listed on a swap execution facility (``SEF'') or designated contract market (``DCM''), the SEF or DCM must set the appropriate minimum block trade size at a level at or above that established by an SDR for the relevant swap instrument.\\18\n",
      " ~~# index: 18||     With respect to anonymity, the Initial Proposal set forth several provisions to address issues pertinent to protecting the identities of parties to a swap. Essentially, these proposed provisions sought to protect the identities of parties to a swap through the limited disclosure of information and data relevant to the swap. In particular, proposed Sec.  43.4(e)(1) in the Initial Proposal provided that an SDR could not publicly report swap transaction and pricing data in a manner that discloses or otherwise facilitates the identification of a party to a swap. Proposed Sec.  43.4(e)(2) would have placed a requirement on SEFs, DCMs and reporting parties to provide an SDR with a specific description of the underlying asset and tenor of a swap. This proposed section also included a qualification with respect to the reporting of the specific description. In particular, this section provided that ``[the] description must be general enough to provide anonymity but specific enough to provide for a meaningful understanding of the economic characteristics of the swap.'' \\19\n",
      " ~~# index: 19||     In the Initial Proposal, the Commission acknowledged that swaps that are executed on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM do not raise the same level of concerns in protecting the identities, business transactions or market positions of swap counterparties since these swaps generally lack customization.\\20\n",
      " ~~# index: 20||     In contrast, the Commission acknowledged that the public dissemination of a description of the specific underlying asset and tenor of swaps that are not executed on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM (i.e., swaps that are executed bilaterally) may result in the unintended disclosure of the identities, business transactions or market positions of swap counterparties, particularly for swaps in the other commodity asset class.\\21\n",
      " ~~# index: 21|| To address this issue, the Commission proposed in Sec.  43.4(e)(2) that an SDR publicly disseminate a more general description of the specific underlying asset and tenor.\\22\n",
      " ~~# index: 22|| in a manner too specific so as to divulge the identity of a swap counterparty. The Commission, however, did not set forth a specific manner in which SDRs should carry out this requirement.\\23\n",
      " ~~# index: 23||     To further protect the identities, business transactions or market positions of swap counterparties, proposed Sec.  43.4(i) of the Initial Proposal included a rounding convention for all swaps, which included a ``notional cap'' provision. The proposed notional cap provision provided, for example, that if the notional size of a swap is greater than $250 million, then an SDR only would publicly disseminate a notation of ``$250+'' rather than the actual notional size of the swap.\\24\n",
      " ~~# index: 24||     The Commission issued the Initial Proposal for public comment for a period of 60 days, but later reopened the comment period for an additional 45 days.\\25\n",

      " ~~# index: 42|| While the Commission anticipates that the public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data will generally reduce costs associated with price discovery and prevent information asymmetries between market makers and end-users,\\43\n",
      " ~~# index: 43||     The Commission understands that the publication of detailed information regarding ``outsize swap transactions'' \\44\n",

      " ~~# index: 45|| In this regard, the publication of detailed information about an outsize swap transaction may alert the market to the possibility that the original liquidity provider to the outsize swap transaction will be re-entering the market to offset that transaction.\\46\n",
      " ~~# index: 46||     In consideration of these potential outcomes, the Further Block Proposal sought to provide maximum public transparency, while taking into account the concerns of liquidity providers regarding possible reductions in market liquidity. To do so, the Further Block Proposal established the following more detailed criteria: (1) Swap categories (relative to the definition of swap instrument in the Initial Proposal); (2) a phased-in approach to determining appropriate minimum block sizes for block trades and large notional off-facility swaps; and (3) anonymity provisions for the public reporting of transaction data. A summary of the Commission's proposed approach is provided below.2. Summary of Proposed Approach    The Commission proposed a two-period, phased-in approach to implement regulations for determining appropriate minimum block sizes.\\47\n",
      " ~~# index: 47||     In proposed Sec.  43.6(e), the Commission proposed establishing initial appropriate minimum block sizes for each category of swaps within the interest rate, credit, foreign exchange (``FX'') and other commodity asset classes.\\48\n",

      " ~~# index: 49|| based on that data. For the other asset classes, the Commission did not have access to relevant market data. As such, during the initial period, the Commission proposed using a methodology based on whether a swap or swap category is ``economically related'' to a futures contract.\\50\n",
      " ~~# index: 50||     In proposed Sec.  43.6(f)(1), the Commission provided that the duration of this initial period would be no less than one year after an SDR started collecting reliable data for a particular asset class as determined by the Commission. During the initial period, the Commission would review reliable data for each asset class. For the purposes of this proposed provision, reliable data would include all data collected by an SDR for each asset class in accordance with the compliance chart in the adopting release to part 45 of the Commission's regulations.\\51\n",
      " ~~# index: 51||     The Commission stated in the Further Block Proposal and is currently of the view that data is per se reliable if it is collected by an SDR for an asset class after the respective compliance date for such asset class as set forth in part 45 of the Commission's regulations or by other Commission action. The Commission notes that SDRs have been collecting data pursuant to the compliance dates for certain market participants and asset classes since December 2012. DCMs and Swap Dealers (``SDs'') began reporting swap transactions in the interest rate and credit default swap asset classes on December 31, 2012.\\52\n",
      " ~~# index: 52|| DCMs and SDs began reporting swap transactions in the FX, equity, and other commodity asset classes on February 28, 2013.\\53\n",

      " ~~# index: 59||     The Commission also proposed special rules for determining appropriate minimum block sizes in certain instances. In particular, in proposed Sec.  43.6(d), the Commission prescribed special rules for swaps in the equity asset class.

The Commission also requested comment with respect to the cost-benefit considerations in the Further Block Proposal and specifically requested commenters to provide a feasible alternative approach to establishing minimum block sizes that would impose less regulatory burden on swap market participants and the general public. Commenters also were expressly invited to provide data regarding the direct and indirect quantifiable costs with the proposed criteria for establishing minimum block thresholds.4. Additional Proposal Regarding Aggregation of Blocks    Among the requirements contained in the Initial Proposal, proposed Sec.  43.5(b)(1) provided that eligible parties to a block trade (or large notional swap) must be Eligible Contract Participants (``ECPs''), except that a DCM may allow a Commodity Trading Advisor (``CTA''), investment advisor, or foreign person meeting certain criteria to transact block trades for customers who are not ECPs. Further, proposed Sec.  43.5(m) prohibited aggregation of orders for different trading accounts in order to satisfy the appropriate minimum block size requirement, except if done so on a DCM by a CTA, investment adviser, or foreign person meeting certain criteria.    After it issued its Further Block Proposal, the Commission determined that the aggregation provision and the provision that specified the eligible parties to a block trade, including the proposed requirement that persons transacting block trades on behalf of customers must receive prior written consent to do so, were inadvertently omitted from the Further Block Proposal. These provisions were then the subject of a separate notice of proposed rulemaking issued on June 27, 2012 (``Proposed Aggregation Rule'').\\63\n",
      " ~~# index: 63||     In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission proposed to use the term ``swap category'' to convey the concept of a grouping of swap contracts that would be subject to a common appropriate minimum block size.\\64\n",
      " ~~# index: 64|| Specifically, the Commission proposed specific criteria for defining swap categories in each asset class. As adopted in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, Sec.  43.2 of the Commission's regulations defines ``asset class'' as ``a broad category of commodities, including, without limitation, any `excluded commodity' as defined in section 1a(19) of the [CEA], with common characteristics underlying a swap.'' \\65\n",
      " ~~# index: 65|| Section 43.2 also identifies the following five swap asset classes: Interest rates; \\66\n",

      " ~~# index: 67|| and other commodities.\\68\n",
      " ~~# index: 68||     The proposed swap category criteria are intended to address the following two policy objectives: (1) Categorizing together swaps with similar quantitative or qualitative characteristics that warrant being subject to the same appropriate minimum block size; and (2) minimizing the number of the swap categories within an asset class in order to avoid unnecessary complexity in the determination process.\\69\n",
      " ~~# index: 69||     Twenty-one commenters addressed the Further Block Proposal's use of swap categories.\\70\n",
      " ~~# index: 70|| The vast majority of the comments did not question the use of swap categories generally, and focused on the specific criteria proposed for determining swap categories within each asset class instead. Better Markets and ICI expressly supported the Commission's proposed use of swap categories.\\71\n",
      " ~~# index: 71|| Better Markets stated that ``the concept of a `swap category' is useful, in that it allows greater granularity than the far broader notion of `asset class.' '' \\72\n",
      " ~~# index: 72|| ICI ``support[ed] the CFTC's proposal to establish categories of swaps within different asset classes that would be subject to a common appropriate minimum block size to better calibrate the block thresholds to the relative liquidity of the swap categories in each asset class.'' \\73\n",
      " ~~# index: 73|| ICAP, however, disagreed with the Commission's use of swap categories and stated that ``the Commission's proposal is mistaken in its use of `swap categories' . . . as opposed to using the standard liquid tenors of swap contracts.'' \\74\n",
      " ~~# index: 74||     After consideration of the comments related to the use of swap categories, the Commission is adopting swap categories as proposed in Sec.  43.6, with certain modifications based upon both general concerns expressed by commenters in regard to the use of swap categories, specific concerns raised in regard to the criteria for determining swap categories within each asset class, and other relevant market developments.\\75\n",

Background    The Commission was able to obtain and review non-public swap data to make inferences about patterns of trading activity, price impact and liquidity in the markets for swaps in the interest rate and credit asset classes.

      " ~~# index: 111||     After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(b)(1)(i) as proposed in regard to currency categories. The currencies were grouped into the three categories in the Further Block Proposal based upon the swap transaction total notional amounts and transaction volumes of currency groups based on the number of transactions, and the average transaction notional amounts of currency groups. The commenters who requested that all currencies be categorized by individual currency mainly focused on differences in liquidity among the four super-major currencies, particularly when comparing interest rate swaps in USD and EUR to those in JPY and GBP. Similarly, the commenters who specifically requested that the Commission establish separate swap categories for each of the super-major currencies focused on perceived differences in liquidity. While USD and EUR interest rate swaps feature the highest liquidity, the Commission is of the view that, based upon all of the criteria mentioned above, the super-major currencies are most similar to each other (and different from major \\112\n",
      " ~~# index: 112||     The Commission considered alternative approaches of using the individual currencies to determine swap categories in the interest rate asset class. While these alternative approaches would have provided greater correlation to an underlying curve than the adopted groupings, the Commission believes that this would not substantially increase the explanation of variations in notional amounts, but rather would result in categories with too few observations. Hence, the Commission does not believe that there would be a significant benefit to offset the additional compliance burden that a more granular approach would impose on market participants. The Commission notes that adoption of the proposed currency categories establishes 27 separate swap categories for interest rate swaps. Separate categorization of all currencies would result in nearly 200 separate swap categories. Separate categorization of the super-major currencies alone would result in 54 swap categories. The Commission believes that the 27 separate swap categories contained in the rule achieves the objectives of grouping swaps with similar characteristics while maintaining a manageable number of swap categories.    The Commission also received a number of comments recommending that interest rate swaps should be categorized based on criteria other than tenor and currency. Four commenters suggested a range of additional interest rate swap categories for the purposes of establishing block thresholds.\\113\n",

Categories having small numbers of observations could be subject to highly volatile minimum block sizes over time. Over-identification also would be expected to lead to underestimations of the ability to offset risks using related swap instruments. The Commission believes that it has struck a balance between over- and under-categorizing swaps that will result in more stable minimum block sizes and allow for adequate risk offsets using instruments within a category. The modification described above in regard to tenor will provide some further granularity at the short end of the yield curve, as suggested by commenters above, while still achieving the objectives of grouping swaps with similar characteristics and reducing unnecessary complexity for market participants in determining whether their swaps are classified within a particular swap category.c.

Accordingly, the Commission proposed three separate conventional spread levels: (1) CDS indexes with spread values under 175 bps; (2) CDS indexes with spread values between 175 and 350 bps; and (3) CDS indexes with spread values above 350 bps.

      " ~~# index: 136||     After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(b)(2) as proposed. In general, the Commission believes that the proposed criteria--tenor and conventional spread--provide an appropriate way to group swaps with economic similarities and to reduce unnecessary complexity for market participants in determining whether a particular swap is classified within a particular swap category. In regard to ISDA/SIFMA's suggested clarification, the Commission clarifies that the spread for a CDS transaction will be based on the traded spread, rather than on the fixed coupon.    Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed tenor and conventional spread categories sufficiently capture the variation in notional size that is necessary for setting appropriate minimum block sizes and that refining these categories as suggested by commenters will not improve the clustering of swaps in order to better set appropriate minimum block sizes. For example, the Commission notes that the tenor buckets contained in the adopted rule generally result in separate categorization for on-the-run and off-the-run indexes for swaps in the CDS data set. On-the-run indexes, for example, comprised the vast majority of swaps in the 4-6 year tenor bucket, while off-the-run indexes were the vast majority of swaps in the 0-2, 2-4, and 6-8.5 year tenor buckets.    The Commission determined these swap categories based on the way activity in the CDS data set clustered towards the center of each tenor band. While the majority of transactions in the CDS data set consisted of on-the-run corporate credit default index swaps with a five-year tenor, the Commission found that significant trading of corporate credit default index swaps also occurred in other tenor ranges.\\137\n",
      " ~~# index: 137|| The Commission believes that its approach is appropriate since CDS on indexes other than corporate indexes (e.g., asset backed indexes, municipal indexes, sovereign indexes) also trade at tenors other than five years.\\138\n",
      " ~~# index: 138||     The Commission, however, decided not to use ``on-the-run'' or ``off-the-run'' designations for grouping CDS indexes into categories for the following reasons: (i) The underlying components of swaps with differing versions or series based on the same named index are broadly similar, if not the same, and are indicative of economic substitutability across versions or series; (ii) differences in the average notional amount across differing versions or series were explained by differences in tenor; and (iii) using versions or series as the criterion for defining CDS swap categories may result in an unnecessary level of complexity.\\139\n",
      " ~~# index: 139|| Hence, the Commission believes that while on-the-run and off-the-run indexes may differ in terms of available liquidity, they nonetheless are economically related to each other within the categories proposed by the Commission; therefore, on-the-run indexes could be used to offset much of the risk associated with off-the-run indices. Moreover, while the off-the-run swaps generally had less trading activity, and presumably less liquidity, than the on-the-run swaps, off-the-run index swaps had larger notional sizes, on average, than on-the run swaps in the same category. Hence, the more liquid, on-the-run swaps will drive the block size in a category and will result in lower block sizes for the less liquid swaps in the category.\\140\n",
      " ~~# index: 140||     In response to the commenters that specifically requested a differentiation between on-the-run and off-the-run CDS indexes, the Commission believes that while on-the-run and off-the-run indexes may differ in terms of available liquidity, they nonetheless are economically related to each other within the categories proposed by the Commission such that on-the-run indexes could be used to offset much of the risk associated with off-the-run indexes. The Commission also notes that the tenor buckets contained in the adopted rule generally result in separate categorization for on-the-run and off-the-run indexes. For the CDS data set, the vast majority of swaps in the 4-6 year tenor bucket were on-the-run indexes, while the vast majority of swaps in the 0-2, 2-4, and 6-8.5 year tenor buckets were off-the-run.    In response to commenters that specifically recommended separate swap categorization for tranches, the Commission believes that the proposed swap categorization based upon conventional spread criteria will result in separate categorizations related to tranches where appropriate.\\141\n",
      " ~~# index: 141|| conventional spread criterion as in adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(2) meets the objectives of grouping swaps with economic similarity and reducing confusion for market participants in determining whether their swaps are classified within a particular swap category.    The Commission believes that this approach will mitigate the administrative burden to both market participants and to the Commission by limiting the number of swap categories for which appropriate minimum block sizes need to be calculated. In regard to Barclay's concern that swaps would move between categories, the Commission believes that instances where a given swap will move daily between spread levels will be limited given the small number of spread categories and the observed distribution of trades. Additionally, the quantitative nature of the block category calculation should limit the operational risk by providing clarity and ease of notice to market participants as to what the minimum block sizes are, even if they are subject to change.    If market participants reach the conclusion that the Commission has determined specific swap categories in a way that will materially reduce market liquidity, then those participants are encouraged to submit data to support their conclusion. If, through its own surveillance of swaps market activity, the Commission becomes aware that a specific swap categorization for determination of appropriate minimum block levels would reduce market liquidity, then the Commission may exercise its legal authority to take action by rule or order to mitigate the potential effects on market liquidity with respect to swaps in that swap category.2. Swap Category in the Equity Asset Class    The Commission proposed a single swap category for swaps in the equity asset class. The Commission proposed this approach based on: (1) The existence of a highly liquid underlying cash market for equities; (2) the absence of time delays for reporting block trades in the underlying equity cash market; (3) the small relative size of the equity index swaps market relative to the futures, options, and cash equity index markets; and (4) the Commission's goal to protect the price discovery function of the underlying equity cash market and futures market.    The Commission received six comments regarding swap categories in the equity asset class. AFR supported the single swap category proposed for the equity asset class.\\142\n",

      " ~~# index: 148||     After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(b)(3) as proposed. While a number of the commenters point out differences in liquidity in the underlying equity indices to support separate swap categories within the equity asset class and establishment of block sizes in equities, these differences do not undermine the premises underlying the Commission's proposal. Even taking into account differences in liquidity, (1) there is still a highly liquid underlying cash market for equities; and (2) the equity index swaps market is small relative to the futures, options, and cash equity index markets. These characteristics, combined with the fact that there are no time delays for reporting block trades in the underlying equity cash market, makes establishment of swap categories, and therefore minimum block thresholds, for equity swaps inappropriate.\\149\n",

With the modifications to Sec.  43.6(b)(4), the euro (EUR) and the Canadian dollar (CAD) combination will still be one swap category as in the original proposal pursuant to Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i).

While the swaps grouped into one category by Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(ii) may have different liquidity levels, these swaps will all be subject to the time delays provided to block trades and large notional off-facility swaps in both the initial and post-initial periods.    The Commission notes that the adopted Sec.  43.6(b)(4)(i) establishes 78 unique currency combinations, covering a vast majority of the notional value of FX swaps concluded by traders in North America.

Additionally, in circumstances where the underlying asset of swap does not apply or otherwise relate to an ``Individual Other Commodity'' or an ``Other'' swap category, the Commission would categorize such swap as either ``Other Agricultural'' or ``Other Non-Agricultural.''    Comments on the proposed swap categories in the other commodity asset class varied.

Furthermore, the Commission believes that its general approach to establishing swap categories under Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i)-(iii) is appropriate and is adopting the text of Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(i)-(iii) largely as proposed, with the exception of some proposed swap categories in Sec.  43.6(b)(5)(ii).\\187\n",

While commodity swaps within a particular swap category may feature different liquidity and risk profiles based on their tenor, the Commission is not aware of any data that would warrant additional swap categories. As swaps trading data becomes available, the Commission will examine such data to determine whether establishing additional swap categories would be appropriate.    The other main modification to the swap categories established under Sec.  43.6(b)(5) is that the Commission is not adopting separate swap categories for swaps that are economically related to the options contracts listed in appendix F of the Further Block Proposal.\\190\n",

      " ~~# index: 288||     With respect to the market depth and market breadth test, the Commission is declining to adopt this approach to determine appropriate minimum block sizes at this time. The Commission considers the test a viable alternative to the notional amount calculation methodology, but also recognizes several prerequisites to implementing such a test. For example, the Commission would need to determine which contracts within a swap category offer pre-trade price transparency--electronically displayed and executable bids and offers as well as displayed available volumes for execution. As noted by commenters, adequate market trading data also must be available to collect a market depth snapshot of all of the bids and offers for the pre-trade price transparency set of applicable contracts. The Commission is also cognizant of MFA's concerns regarding the potential for manipulation of market depth. Given the time needed for trading infrastructure to develop and the significant time and cost considerations involved in collecting such data from SEFs and DCMs, the Commission will continue to examine the merits of adopting the market depth and market breadth test.    The Commission is currently of the view that data is per se reliable if it is collected by an SDR for an asset class after the respective compliance date for such asset class as set forth in part 45 of the Commission's regulations or by other Commission action. The Commission notes that SDRs have been collecting data pursuant to the compliance dates for certain market participants and asset classes since December 2012.

Based upon the numerous comments recommending a data set covering a shorter time frame, the Commission will determine post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes under Sec.  43.6(f)(2) utilizing a one-year window of swap transaction and pricing data. This approach will allow the Commission to better calibrate block thresholds to changes in market liquidity, while at the same time providing enough data to smooth out fluctuations in data such as those that may result from, for example, seasonality.    As referenced above, the Commission proposed to amend Sec.  43.2 of the Commission's regulations to define the term ``trimmed data set'' as a data set that has had extraordinarily large notional transactions removed by transforming the data into a logarithm with a base of ten (Log<INF>10</INF>), computing the mean, and excluding transactions that are beyond four standard deviations above the mean. Proposed Sec.  43.6(c) uses this term in connection with the calculations that the Commission would undertake in determining appropriate minimum block sizes and cap sizes.    The Commission received five comments regarding the proposed use of a trimmed data set. Three commenters supported the use of a trimmed data set, but suggested alternative approaches. ISDA/SIFMA opposed the proposed methodology and believed that it would establish a threshold that is too high to exclude large transactions.\\304\n",
      " ~~# index: 304|| Therefore, ISDA/SIFMA recommended that the Commission look instead at the raw block size (calculated based on all transactions in the relevant swap category) and eliminate any trades more than five times larger than the block threshold.\\305\n",

      " ~~# index: 308|| Better Markets stated that the Commission should disclose the discrepancies between using a trimmed data set versus an unfiltered data set to calculate the block size threshold because the public lacks the data to make this determination on its own.\\309\n",

The Commission believes that removing the largest transactions, but not the smallest transactions, may provide a better data set for establishing the appropriate minimum block size, given that the smallest transactions may reflect liquidity available to offset large transactions. Moreover, in the context of setting a block trade level (or large notional off-facility swap level), a method to determine relatively large swap transactions should be distinguished from a method to determine extraordinarily large transactions; the latter may skew measures of the central tendency of transaction size (i.e., transactions of usual size) away from a more representative value of the center.\\310\n",

Special Provisions for the Determination of Appropriate Minimum Block Sizes for Certain Types of Swaps    The Commission recognizes the complexity of the swaps market may make it difficult to determine appropriate minimum block sizes for particular types of swaps under the methodologies discussed above.

Swaps With Optionality    A swap with optionality highlights special concerns in terms of determining whether the notional size of such swap would be treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. Proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(1) addressed these concerns by providing that the notional size of swaps with optionality would equal the notional size of the swap component without the optional component. For example, a LIBOR 3-month call swaption with a calculated notional size of $9 billion for the swap component--regardless of option component, strike price, or the appropriate delta factor--would have a notional size of $9 billion for the purpose of determining whether the swap would qualify as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap.\\392\n",

      " ~~# index: 397||     After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(h)(1) as proposed. In response to ICAP Energy, the Commission believes that the proposed approach provides an easily calculable method for market participants to ascertain whether their swaps with optionality features would qualify as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. The Commission is aware that this approach does not take into account the risk profile of a swap with optionality compared to that of a ``plain-vanilla swap,'' but believes that this approach is reasonable to minimize complexity.b. Swaps With Composite Reference Prices    Swaps with two or more reference prices (i.e., composite reference prices) raise concerns as to which reference price market participants should use to determine whether such swap qualifies as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap.\\398\n",
      " ~~# index: 398|| Proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(2) provides that the parties to a swap transaction with composite reference prices (i.e., two or more reference prices) may elect to apply the lowest appropriate minimum block size applicable to any component swap category. This provision also would apply to: (1) Locational or grade-basis swaps that reflect differences between two or more reference prices; and (2) swaps utilizing a reference price based on weighted averages of component reference prices.\\399\n",
      " ~~# index: 399||     Under proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(2), market participants would need to decompose their composite reference price swap transaction in order to determine whether their swap would qualify as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. For example, assume that the appropriate minimum block size for futures A-related swaps is $3 million, for futures B-related swaps is $800,000, for futures C-related swaps is $1.2 million and for futures D-related swaps is $1 million. If a swap is based on a composite reference price that itself is based on the weighted average of futures price A, futures price B, futures price C, and futures price D (25% equal weightings for each), and the notional size of the swap is $4 million (i.e., $1 million for each component swap), then the swap would qualify as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap based on the futures B-related swap appropriate minimum block size.    The Commission received one comment regarding proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(2). AFR recommended that transactions that are composites of swaps that are economically equivalents of futures contracts should be disaggregated and separately priced for the purpose of determining applicability of the block rules. AFR also recommended that the Commission be vigilant of the use of composite swaps by counterparties in order to ``evade the purpose of Section 727 and the Proposed Rules.'' \\400\n",
      " ~~# index: 400||     With respect to spread transactions, ICAP Energy recommended that the minimum block size limit be based upon the lowest limit leg of the transaction, in a manner consistent with the proposed approach to setting minimum block size limits for the mixed asset swap class.\\401\n",
      " ~~# index: 401||     Based upon the comments received, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(h)(2) with certain clarifications based upon general concerns expressed by commenters regarding the use of composite swaps to evade minimum block sizes. The Commission is of the view that this rule provides market participants with a straightforward and uncomplicated way in which to determine whether such swap would qualify as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, but that a clarification is needed to avoid the risk of evasion raised by commenters. In response to ICAP Energy's comments, the Commission highlights to provide clarity that ``any component swap category'' as used above in the methodology applies to swaps with a single Unique Swap Identifier (``USI'') for the combination of swaps identified with a single Unique Product Identifier (``UPI'') and not to groups of different swaps each with separate USIs transacted on or near the same time.\\402\n",
      " ~~# index: 402||     To provide further clarity and clarification in response to AFR's comment, the Commission provides the following additional example of determining whether a composite reference price swap transaction would qualify as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. For example, assume that the appropriate minimum block size for swap category E is $50 million and for swap category F is $200 million. If a single swap transaction with a corresponding singular reporting obligation is based on a composite reference price that itself is based on the weighted average of (1) one component in swap category E; (2) a second component in swap category E; and (3) a component in swap category F (33% equal weightings for each), and the notional size of the swap is $75 million (i.e., $25 million for each component swap), then the swap would not qualify as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap based on either the swap category E or the swap category F appropriate minimum block size.c. Physical Commodity Swaps    Block trade sizes for physical commodities are generally expressed in terms of notional quantities (e.g., barrels, bushels, gallons, metric tons, troy ounces, etc.). The Commission proposed a similar convention for determining the appropriate minimum block sizes for block trades and large notional off-facility swaps. In particular, proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(3) provides that notional sizes for physical commodity swaps shall be expressed in terms of notional quantities using the notional unit measure utilized in the related futures contract market or the predominant notional unit measure used to determine notional quantities in the cash market for the relevant, underlying physical commodity. This approach ensures that appropriate minimum block size thresholds for physical commodities are not subject to volatility introduced by fluctuating prices. This approach also eliminates complications arising from converting a physical commodity transaction in one currency into another currency to determine qualification for treatment as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap.    The Commission received no comments regarding proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(3). The Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(h)(3) as proposed.d. Currency Conversion    Under proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(4), the Commission provided that when determining whether a swap transaction denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars qualifies as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, swap counterparties and registered entities may use a currency exchange rate that is widely published within the preceding two business days from the date of execution of the swap transaction in order to determine such qualification. This proposed approach would enable market participants to use a currency exchange rate that they deem to be the most appropriate or easiest to obtain.    The Commission received no comments regarding proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(4). The Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(h)(4) as proposed.e.

The proposed rule includes an exception to the ECP requirement by providing that a DCM may allow (i) A CTA registered pursuant to Section 4n of the CEA, or exempt from registration under the CEA, or a principal thereof, who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts, (ii) an investment adviser who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria the criteria of 4.7(a)(2)(v0 of the Commission's regulations, or (iii) a foreign person who performs a similar role or function to the persons described in (i) or (ii) and is subject as such to foreign regulation, to transact block trades for customers who are not ECPs, if such CTA, investment adviser or foreign person has more than $25 million in total assets under management.

      " ~~# index: 463||     After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(i) as proposed. The Commission declines to adopt ICI's clarification and notes that Sec.  43.6(i)(2) is intended to ensure that all customers of CTAs, investment advisers, and similar foreign persons, whether the customers are ECPs or not, are fully informed of the use of block trades on their behalf.    The Commission also disagrees with SIFMA's contention regarding the burdens of obtaining consent. This burden consent will be minimal because Sec.  43.6(i)(2) states that the instruction or consent may be provided through a power of attorney or similar document that provides discretionary trading authority or the authority to direct trading in the account. The consent may therefore be included in existing and future customer agreements. The Commission further disagrees that a general grant of investment discretion or notice to the customer should satisfy Sec.  43.6(i)(2). A customer's written instruction or consent is necessary because a customer potentially may not receive the best terms for an individual swap transaction that is part of an aggregation. The written instruction or consent makes the customer aware that block trades may be used on its behalf, allowing the customer to decide whether to allow these transactions.

The Commission proposed to follow the practices used by most federal agencies when releasing to the public company-specific information--by removing obvious identifiers, limiting geographic detail (e.g., disclosing general, non-specific geographical information about the delivery and pricing points) and masking high-risk variables by truncating extreme values for certain variables (e.g., capping notional values).\\466\n",
      " ~~# index: 466|| 1. Policy Goals for Establishing Notional Cap Sizes    In addition to establishing appropriate minimum block sizes, the Commission also proposed to amend Sec.  43.4(h) to establish cap sizes for notional and principal amounts that would mask the total size of a swap transaction if it equals or exceeds the appropriate minimum block size for a given swap category. For example, if the block size for a category of interest rate swaps was $1 billion, the cap size was $1.5 billion, and the actual transaction had a notional value of $2 billion, then this swap transaction would be publicly reported with a delay and with a notional value of $1.5+ billion.    The proposed cap size provisions are consistent with the two relevant statutory requirements in section 2(a)(13) of the CEA. First, the cap size provisions would help protect the anonymity of counterparties' market positions and business transactions as required in section 2(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the CEA.\\467\n",
      " ~~# index: 467|| Second, the masking of extraordinarily large positions also takes into consideration the requirement under section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv) that the Commission take into account the impact that real-time public reporting could have in reducing market liquidity.\\468\n",

Proposed Amendments Related to Cap Sizes--Sec.  43.2 Definitions and Sec.  43.4 Swap Transaction and Pricing Data To Be Publicly Disseminated in Real-Time    The Commission proposed an amendment to Sec.  43.2 to define the term ``cap size'' as the maximum limit of the principal, notional amount of a swap that is publicly disseminated. This term applies to the cap sizes determined in accordance with the proposed amendments to Sec.  43.4(h) of the Commission's regulations.    Section 43.4(h) of the Commission's regulations currently establishes interim cap sizes for rounded notional or principal amounts for all publicly reportable swap transactions. In the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, the Commission finalized Sec.  43.4(h) to provide that the notional or principal amounts shall be capped in a manner that adjusts in accordance with the appropriate minimum block size that corresponds to a publicly reportable swap transaction.\\469\n",
      " ~~# index: 469|| Section 43.4(h) further provides that if no appropriate minimum block size exists, then the cap size on the notional or principal amount shall correspond to the interim cap sizes that the Commission has established for the five asset classes.\\470\n",

EEI instead recommended both a fixed cap size and a minimum block size of $3 million.\\477\n",
      " ~~# index: 477|| Sec.  43.4(h)(1) as proposed. EEI recommends a lower cap size for specific swap categories--particularly electricity swaps--but it does not recommend any change to the proposed interplay between cap size and appropriate minimum block size during the interim period. The cap size for the interim period was established by the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, and the Commission considered the appropriate level for these cap sizes at that time. The Commission did not propose altering the interim cap size in the Further Block Proposal, and thus did not receive comments regarding altering the interim cap size beyond that of EEI. The Commission does not believe that altering the interim cap size would be appropriate under such circumstances.    AII and ISDA/SIFMA recommended that the cap size be set as the lower of the appropriate minimum block size and the interim cap sizes set forth in the Real-Time Reporting Rule. The Commission, however, disagrees with this view of the relationship between block thresholds and cap sizes. All of the information regarding a block trade is reported to the market at the end of the block time delay. Cap sizes, on the other hand, are never expressed to the market. Because this information is not reported to the market in real-time, nor reported to the market at all, the Commission believes that cap sizes should be set at a higher level than block sizes, in order to minimize the amount of information that is never publicly disseminated. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.4(h)(1) as proposed.b. Post-Initial Cap Sizes and the 75-Percent Notional Amount Calculation    Pursuant to proposed Sec.  43.4(h)(2)(ii), the Commission would use a 75 percent notional amount calculation, as proposed in Sec.  43.6(c)(2), to determine the appropriate post-initial cap sizes for all swap categories for the purpose of reporting block trades or large notional off-facility swaps of significant size.\\478\n",
      " ~~# index: 478|| This calculation methodology would be different from the 67 percent notional amount calculation methodology that the Commission proposed in Sec.  43.6(c)(1), which would be used to determine appropriate minimum block sizes.\\479\n",
      " ~~# index: 479||     For the 75 percent notional amount calculation, the Commission would determine the appropriate cap size through the following process, pursuant to proposed Sec.  43.6(c)(2): (step 1) select all of the publicly reportable swap transactions within a specific swap category using a rolling three-year window of data beginning with a minimum of one year's worth of data and adding one year of data for each calculation until a total of three years of data is accumulated; (step 2) convert to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data set; (step 3) determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the trimmed data set; (step 4) multiply the sum of the notional amount by 75 percent; (step 5) rank order the observations by notional amount from least to greatest; (step 6) calculate the cumulative sum of the observations until the cumulative sum is equal to or greater than the 75 percent notional amount calculated in step 4; (step 7) select the notional amount associated with that observation; (step 8) round the notional amount of that observation to two significant digits, or if the notional amount associated with that observation is already significant to two digits, increase that notional amount to the next highest rounding point of two significant digits; and (step 9) set the appropriate minimum block size at the amount calculated in step 8.    Consistent with the Commission's proposed process to determine the appropriate post-initial minimum block sizes, proposed Sec.  43.4(h)(3) provided that the Commission would publish post-initial cap sizes on its Web site. Proposed Sec.  43.4(h)(4) provided that unless otherwise indicated on the Commission's Web site, the post-initial cap sizes would become effective on the first day of the second month following the date of publication.    The Commission received 10 comments regarding the 75 percent notional amount calculation for determining post-initial cap sizes. One commenter, Javelin, supported the 75 percent notional amount calculation and stated that it was consistent with the minimum block size threshold established by the Commission.\\480\n",
      " ~~# index: 480||     Seven commenters, however, recommended that the Commission set post-initial cap sizes matching the post-initial minimum block size thresholds established by the Commission. AII recommended setting the post-initial cap size for each swap category at the same level as the post-initial block size threshold and states that the 75 percent notional amount calculation is far too high.\\481\n",

      " ~~# index: 490||     Section 43.4(d)(4) contains special provisions for swaps in the other commodity asset class. These swaps raise special concerns because the public disclosure of the underlying asset(s) may in turn reveal the identities, market positions and business transactions of the swap counterparties. To address these concerns, Sec.  43.4(d)(4) limits the types of swaps in the other commodity asset class that are subject to public dissemination. Specifically, Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) of the Commission's regulations provides that, for publicly reportable swap transactions in the other commodity asset class, SDRs must publicly disseminate the actual underlying assets only for: (1) those swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM; (2) those swaps referencing one of the contracts described in appendix B to part 43; and (3) those swaps that are economically related to one of the contracts described in appendix B to part 43.\\491\n",

In particular, proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) provides that SDRs must publicly disseminate the details about the geographic location of the underlying assets of the other commodity swaps not described in Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) (i.e., other commodity swaps that have a specific delivery or pricing point) pursuant to proposed appendix E to part 43. Proposed appendix E to part 43 is discussed in the next subsection.    The Commission recognizes that requiring the public dissemination of less specific geographic detail for an other commodity swap may, to some extent, diminish the price discovery value of swap transaction and pricing data for such swap. The Commission believes, however, that the public dissemination of such data will still provide the market with useful information relating to market depth, trading activity and pricing information for similar types of swaps.    The Commission also proposed making conforming amendments to Sec.  43.4(d). Specifically, the Commission proposed amending the introductory language to Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(i) by deleting ``Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii)'' and adding in its place ``Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) and (iii)'' to make clear that SDRs have to publicly disseminate swaps data under Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) in accordance with part 43.\\496\n",

The Commission proposed that an SDR publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data for certain energy and power swaps in the other commodity asset class, as described in more detail below, in a different manner than the remaining other commodities. In order to mask the specific delivery or pricing detail of these energy and power swaps, the Commission proposed using established regions or markets that are associated with these underlying assets.i.

For any other pricing points in the United States, SDRs would publicly disseminate the term ``Other U.S.'' in place of the actual pricing or delivery point for such electricity and sources swaps.iv. All Remaining Other Commodities    In proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) and proposed appendix E to part 43, the Commission set forth a method to describe any swaps in the other commodity asset class that do not have oil, natural gas, electricity, or petroleum as an underlying asset, but have specific delivery or pricing points in the United States. In particular, the Commission proposed that SDRs publicly disseminate information with respect to these swaps based on the 10 federal regions established by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (``EIA''). The Commission believed that the use of the 10 federal regions would provide consistency among different types of underlying assets in the other commodity asset class with respect to delivery and pricing point descriptions.    The 10 federal regions that SDRs would use for public dissemination under the proposal for all remaining other commodity swaps are as follows: (i) Region I (including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont); (ii) Region II (including New Jersey and New York); (iii) Region III (including Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia); (iv) Region IV (including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee); (v) Region V (including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin); (vi) Region VI (including Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas); (vii) Region VII (including Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska); (viii) Region VIII (including Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming); (ix) Region IX (including Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada); and (x) Region X (including Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington).\\505\n",

The Commission is of the view that SDRs should not publicly disseminate the actual location for these international delivery or pricing points since the public disclosure of such information may disclose the identities of parties, business transactions and market positions of market participants. In Table E2, the Commission proposed the countries and regions that an SDR must publicly disseminate. In proposing the use of these geographic breakdowns for the public reporting of international delivery or pricing points, the Commission considered world regions that have significant energy consumption, whether ISDA-specific documentation exists for a particular country, and whether public disclosure would compromise the anonymity of the swap counterparties.    The Commission proposed the following international regions for publicly disseminating specific delivery or pricing points of publicly reportable swap transactions described in Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii): (i) North America (publicly disseminate ``Canada'' or ``Mexico''); (ii) Central America (publicly disseminate ``Central America''); (iii) South America (publicly disseminate ``Brazil'' or ``Other South America''); (iv) Europe (publicly disseminate ``Western Europe,'' ``Northern Europe,'' ``Southern Europe,'' or ``Eastern Europe''); (v) Russia (publicly disseminate ``Russia''); \\506\n",

Currently, Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii)(A)-(B) requires an SDR to publicly disseminate the actual underlying asset of the leg of the basis swap that references or is economically related to a contract listed in appendix B to part 43. To the extent that a basis swap is executed on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM, an SDR would also publicly disseminate the specific underlying asset.

      " ~~# index: 517||     On January 9, 2012, the Commission issued the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, which includes three collections of information requirements within the meaning of the PRA. The first collection of information requirement under Part 43 imposed a reporting requirement on a SEF or DCM when a swap is executed on a trading facility or on the parties to a swap transaction when the swap is executed bilaterally. The second collection of information requirement under Part 43 created a public dissemination requirement on SDRs. The third collection of information requirement created a recordkeeping requirement for SEFs, DCMs, SDRs and any reporting party (as such term is defined in part 43 of the Commission's regulations).    Sections 43.4 and 43.6 amend the first and second collections of information within the meaning of the PRA as described below. The analysis with respect to the amended collections as a result of Sec.  43.6 is set out in section 1 below. The analysis with respect to the amended collections as a result of amendments to Sec.  43.4 is set out in section 2 below.1. Sec.  43.6(g)--Notification of Election    Section 43.6(g) amends the first and second collections of information within the meaning of the PRA. In particular, Sec.  43.6(g) contains the provisions regarding the election to have a swap transaction treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, as applicable. Section 43.6(g)(1) establishes a two-step notification process relating to block trades. Section 43.6(g)(2) establishes the notification process relating to large notional off-facility swaps. Section 43.6(g) is an essential part of this rulemaking because it provides the mechanism through which market participants will be able to elect to treat their qualifying swap transaction as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap.    Section 43.6(g)(1)(i) contains the first step in the two-step notification process relating to block trades. In particular, this section provides that the parties to a swap that are executed at or above the appropriate minimum block size for the applicable swap category are required to notify the SEF or DCM (as applicable) of their election to have their qualifying swap transaction treated as a block trade. The Commission understands that SEFs and DCMs use automated, electronic, and in some cases, voice processes to execute swap transactions; therefore, the transmission of the notification of a block trade election also would either be automated, electronic or communicated through voice.    The Commission estimates that there are 125 SDs and MSPs, and 1,000 other non-financial end-user parties.\\518\n",
      " ~~# index: 518|| The Commission estimates that, on average, SD/MSP reporting parties would likely notify a SEF or DCM of a block trade election approximately 1,000 times per year while non-SD/MSP reporting parties likely would notify a SEF or DCM of a block trade election approximately five times per year.\\519\n",
      " ~~# index: 519|| Thus, the Commission estimates that there would be 130,000 notifications of a block trade election by reporting parties under Sec.  43.6(g) each year.\\520\n",

SDs, MSPs and reporting parties would use existing traders (or other professionals earning similar salaries) to electronically transmit or otherwise communicate their notice of election. Based on the Securities Industry and Financial Market Association's 2011 Securities Industry Salary Survey, the Commission estimates that these block traders would earn approximately $184.90 per hour in total compensation.\\521\n",

As noted above, the Commission anticipates that SEFs and DCMs would use automated, electronic and, in some cases, voice processes to execute swap transactions. The Commission estimates that there will be approximately 58 SEFs and DCMs. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the total annual burden associated with the second step in Sec.  43.6(g)(1)(ii) would be approximately $610,740 in non-recurring annualized capital and start-up costs.\\525\n",
      " ~~# index: 525||     Section 43.6(g)(2) is similar to the first step set forth in Sec.  43.6(g)(1). That is, Sec.  43.6(g)(2) provides, in part, that a reporting party who executes a bilateral swap transaction that is at or above the appropriate minimum block size is required to notify the SDR of its election to treat such swap as a large notional off-facility swap. This section provides further that the reporting party is required to notify the SDR in connection with the reporting party's transmission of swap transaction and pricing data to the SDR for public dissemination. The Commission anticipates that reporting parties may have various methods through which they will transmit information to SDRs, which would include a large notional off-facility swap election. Most reporting parties would use automated and electronic methods to transmit this information; other reporting parties, because of the expense associated with building an electronic infrastructure, may contract with third parties (including their swap counterparty) to transmit the notification of a large notional off-facility swap election.    The Commission estimates that the incremental time and cost burden associated with the Sec.  43.6(g)(2) would include: (i) One minute for a reporting party to determine whether a particular swap transaction qualifies as a large notional off-facility swap based on the appropriate minimum block size of the applicable swap category; and (ii) one minute for the reporting party (or its designee) to electronically transmit or communicate through voice processes its notice of election.

Accordingly, the Commission estimates that there are, on average, approximately 67,500 notifications large notional off-facility swaps under Sec.  43.6 each year. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the total annual burden associated with Sec.  43.6(g)(2) would be approximately 2,250 annual labor hours or $416,025 in annual labor costs.\\528\n",

While this departure from the proposal means that fewer swaps will be subject to real-time transparency during the initial period, it affords the Commission the opportunity to collect and analyze data on the use of block thresholds and to apply that data to its evaluation of the risks attendant to a less transparent market. Simultaneously introducing a conservative, 50 percent threshold also allows the Commission to assess whether there are material reductions in the liquidity for some swaps and take any measures to stave off those reductions, as the rules allow the Commission to review and refine the thresholds as liquidity and transparency needs may warrant in the future.\\567\n",

The rule also sets forth a schedule whereby the Commission will calculate and publish all appropriate minimum block sizes across all asset classes no less than once each calendar year, following an initial period (as described below).b. Rule 43.6(b) Swap Category    Rule 43.6(b) specifies the Commission's approach for grouping swaps by asset class based on existing liquidity in underlying cash markets, relevant economic indicators, the underlying asset class, and the Commission's analysis of relevant swap market data supplied to the Commission.\\574\n",

Appendix F to part 43 contains a schedule of appropriate minimum block sizes effective during the initial period. The schedule reflects a different appropriate minimum block size methodology for the interest rate and credit asset classes than for the equity, FX and other commodity asset classes. The initial appropriate minimum block sizes for the interest rate and credit asset class are derived from data supplied by the ODSG.\\575\n",

Overview of Comments Received    The Commission received numerous comments regarding the potential costs and benefits to market participants and the public in response to the rules establishing the criteria and methodology for determining block thresholds. Commenters were divided on whether the Commission properly considered costs or misstated or ignored the benefits of the rules. Some commenters touched on the cost benefit considerations directly by promoting various alternatives to the proposed rules.\\578\n",

Direct Costs    Rules 43.6(a)-(f) and (h) will impose recurring costs on swap market participants and registered entities (i.e., SEFs, DCMs, or SDRs) to accommodate the Commission's publication of post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes at least once each calendar year following the initial period. In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission anticipated that in order for registered entities to comply with the rule, they would need to update their existing data systems and that process would entail approximately 40 initial, non-recurring personnel hours at an approximate cost of $2,728 for each registered entity.\\579\n",
      " ~~# index: 578||     Market participants other than registered entities, and specifically non-financial end users, expectedly will need to train their existing personnel and update their written policies and procedures to comply with Sec.  43.6(a)-(f) and (h). The Commission estimated that the training and updating of policies and procedures will impose an initial non-recurring burden of approximately 15 personnel hours at an approximate cost of $1,430 for each non-financial end-user.\\580\n",
      " ~~# index: 579||     The Commission received one comment specifically addressing direct costs. WMBAA disagreed with the Further Block Proposal's projected cost estimates and contended that the Commission's approach ``is overly simplistic and does not contemplate the actual efforts a SEF will have to undertake to implement the block trade regime, including the two-step notification process, the technology upgrades, providing training to existing personnel and updating written policies and procedures, among other necessary actions to comply with the CFTC's proposed rule.'' \\581\n",
      " ~~# index: 580||     Because WMBAA did not provide data to support or monetize its cost concern, the Commission has considered them qualitatively. Further, WMBAA's disagreement with the Further Block Proposal's cost estimates does not concern the incremental cost to augment and maintain systems and processes that the Commission believes entities need have in place to comply with the real time reporting requirement of Section 2(a)(13) of the CEA; rather it concerns the cost to comply with that statutory requirement as prescribed by the existing part 43 implementation regulations. SEFs and DCMs would incur these costs regardless of how the Commission determines block thresholds. Accordingly, the Commission considers WMBAA's criticism of the cost estimates in this rulemaking misplaced. Moreover, the Commission has intentionally structured the requirements of Sec.  43.6(a) to mitigate these costs; this rule's approach seeks to leverage the existing connectivity, infrastructure and arrangements that market participants and registered entities will have already established to comply with the part 43 regulations.    The Commission did not find, nor was it provided, additional information that was sufficient to change the cost basis. Therefore, the Commission is maintaining the Further Block Proposal's approach to calculating the direct costs resulting from the methodology for determining block thresholds. However, the Commission is revising its estimates to reflect wage rate data updated since the Further Block Proposal was published. The Commission estimates that for registered entities to update existing technology as necessary will entail approximately 40 initial, non-recurring personnel hours at an approximate cost of $2,874 for each registered entity.\\582\n",

Indirect Costs    The Commission received numerous comments regarding indirect costs that could result from the establishment of criteria and methodology for setting appropriate minimum block thresholds. The majority of these comments focused on the issue of market liquidity; and many of the comments provided alternatives for either lower notional amount calculation thresholds, and extended phase-in or restricting the asset classes to which thresholds would apply.

      " ~~# index: 608||     The Commission also received comments suggesting costs in terms of market liquidity or other factors in setting the appropriate minimum block thresholds too low (or benefits in setting the appropriate minimum block thresholds at 67 percent of notional or higher).

      " ~~# index: 614|| for transparency while accounting for possible material reductions in liquidity through the phasing-in of real-time reporting of a portion of the swaps market. In contrast, SIFMA's suggestion of treating all swaps as blocks while the Commission collects data inverts the public policy rationale underlying congressional requirements for transparency through real-time public reporting. The most useful data for determining at what levels blocks would be appropriate is data collected for swaps reported in real-time when market participants have the ability to execute block trades above minimum block thresholds. Data collected prior to the point where real-time reporting and block levels are functioning together is useful (and has been used by the Commission in fashioning block thresholds in the initial period for swaps in the interest rate and credit asset classes), but provides an incomplete picture absent implementation of the real-time reporting regime. The Commission's 67 percent notional amount calculation in the post-initial period is designed to adjust appropriate minimum block levels once this data becomes available.    Notwithstanding the fact that the commenters did not provide data to support or monetize their cost concerns, the Commission has considered their qualitative comments regarding the potential costs that the Commission's appropriate minimum block threshold methodology may have on market liquidity.    The Commission agrees with Vanguard that transparency ultimately promotes increased market liquidity. Transparency afforded through the publication of swap transaction and pricing data is likely to attract more market participants to the market place, thereby increasing market liquidity depth. However, the Commission also understands the tension between achieving greater swap transaction transparency and liquidity: required reporting of large transactions without a time delay (i.e., as soon as technologically practicable) presents potential for downside cost to certain market participants, most particularly market makers providing liquidity. The immediate reporting of swaps that approach, but fall shy of the appropriate minimum block size threshold, may in certain circumstances increase the difficulty, and thus cost, for liquidity providers to lay off attendant price risks in the market. As the commenters suggest, market makers ultimately could pass these costs on to their end-user clients.    Recognizing the potential for such indirect costs, the Commission believes it has designed the criteria and methodology outlined in the rule in a manner that strikes an appropriate balance between the importance of price discovery and transparency, and concerns about potential costs to market participants. By establishing a 67 percent notional amount calculation for appropriate minimum block thresholds in the post initial period, the Commission will bring transparency through real-time reporting to the vast majority of transactions in the swap market.    The Commission believes that the phase-in approach provides swap market participants with adequate time to incrementally adjust their trading practices, technology infrastructure and business arrangements to comply with the new block trade regime. As a result, the rule's approach promotes liquidity since the Commission believes that a transparent market with improved pre-trade price transparency is likely to attract customers. The Commission expects that indirect costs described above will be mitigated through improved price discovery and a decrease in the cost of hedging practices for end users due to improved transparency and competition in the marketplace.    The Commission also considered the potential that different swaps and futures block criteria and methodology might competitively disadvantage SEFs to the extent certain market participants consider swaps and futures products competitive substitutes; thus, in turn, frustrating public interests that Congress, in authorizing SEFs in the Dodd-Frank Act, intended to further. For several reasons, the Commission does not believe this will occur. First, as discussed in the SEF Rulemaking, the Commission has provided SEFs with various functionalities designed to provide flexibility that will promote the trading of swaps on SEFs.\\616\n",
      " ~~# index: 615|| Second, by using futures block thresholds as a reference for initially setting the criteria for economically related swaps, the rule, at a minimum, substantially mitigates any such theoretical costs. Further, the Commission has, and will use, corrective tools if experience in these newly-regulated markets indicates potential for differences in swaps and futures block criteria and methodology to harm market users through hindered product competition. These tools include periodical recalibration of swap criteria as anticipated under this rule as well as the Commission's ability to exercise its legal authority to take action by rule or order to mitigate any potential harm due to hindered competition.\\617\n",
      " ~~# index: 616|| 4. Benefits    The Commission believes that Sec.  43.6(a)-(f) and (h) will generate several overarching benefits to swap market participants, registered entities and the general public. Most notably, the Commission expects that the criteria and methodologies for setting appropriate minimum block sizes will provide greater price transparency for a substantial portion of swap transactions in a manner carefully calibrated to preserve and promote swaps market liquidity. More specifically, the regulations will provide price transparency by lifting the current part 43 real-time reporting time delay \\618\n",
      " ~~# index: 617|| well as to cause a decrease in the cost of hedging due to improved transparency and competition in the market. The Commission also expects that lower hedging costs and improved transparency will reduce systemic risk potential. A swaps market that is transparent to regulators and the public in real-time, without the interim delays for all transactions imposed in Part 43, provides for a system that will assist the Commission's oversight ability. Finally, the Commission believes that this added transparency will ultimately strengthen the swaps market by affording academics, the media, public and market participants the opportunity to monitor, study, and analyze these previously opaque segments of the economy.    The rules' phased-in implementation will introduce greater transparency in an incremental, measured and flexible manner so that appropriate minimum block sizes can respond to changing markets. Section 43.6(f)(2) permits the Commission to set appropriate minimum block sizes no less than once annually during the post-initial period. If swap market conditions were to change significantly after the implementation of the provisions of this final rule, there is nothing that prevents the Commission from reacting to take action further improving price transparency or mitigating adverse effects on market liquidity. In an effort to add more flexibility to respond to continuing swaps market evolution, the methodology in Sec.  43.6(c)-(f) and (h) will recalibrate appropriate minimum block sizes regularly to ensure that those sizes remain appropriate for, and responsive to, these changing markets.5. Alternatives    The Commission considered alternatives to the determination criteria and methodology adopted in this rulemaking. The chief alternatives raised by commenters or otherwise considered by the Commission concerned three topics--Commission's determination of minimum block sizes, swap categories, and block methodology--as discussed below.a. Commission Determination of Minimum Block Sizes    Under Sec.  43.6(a) the Commission will determine minimum block sizes; this approach limits the direct burden on market participants and registered entities relative to an alternative that would require them to engage a quantitative analysis to ascertain appropriate minimum block sizes for themselves. Such an alternative approach is inconsistent with the statutory requirement of CEA section 2(a)(13)(E)(ii) that the Commission ``specify the criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional swap transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts.'' \\619\n",
      " ~~# index: 618|| b. Swap Category Alternatives    Commenters \\620\n",
      " ~~# index: 619|| noted what they described as a lack of granularity in the Commission's choice of swaps categories, which they cautioned would result in the grouping of liquid swaps together with illiquid swaps in the same swap category. Vanguard \\621\n",
      " ~~# index: 620|| suggested a more granular approach to setting swap categories and block sizes according to ``distinct liquidity pools.'' ISDA/SIFMA \\622\n",
      " ~~# index: 621|| suggested subjecting a swap to block thresholds as long as the swap has sufficient trading frequency and trades in such volume that allows full hedging in a short period of time and also prevents widening of the spread as a result of public reporting. In support of such a test, the comment cited research and data to suggest that disclosure does not necessarily lead to increased transparency and swaps with varying levels of liquidity will be subject to the same block size. Many commenters expressed that the Commission's determination of swap categories would result in block levels that are insufficiently granular to account for differences between swap asset classes and within swap categories, including the differences in transaction frequency and volume.\\623\n",
      " ~~# index: 622|| Some commenters suggested that all infrequently traded swaps, under a specified level, should be treated as block trades.\\624\n",
      " ~~# index: 623||     The Commission believes that its approach of establishing specific criteria for grouping swaps into a finite set of defined swap categories is preferable to the alternatives noted; it provides (1) appropriate granularity that mitigates the potential for like risks to trade differently; and (2) a clear organizational framework that avoids administrative burdens for market participants that otherwise could arise from more numerous and/or non-uniform swap categories. The Commission made use of swaps market data, as well as market convention, in making its determination of how best to form swap categories and asset classes as well as buckets within each asset class. Ultimately, the Commission determined that that the best approach was to allow for products with similar characteristics and risk structures to be grouped together, given that in certain circumstances market participants view similar financial products as close substitutes and use them as such for risk mitigating purposes. The Commission has fashioned its swaps categories to, where possible, group together swaps that could be used to hedge the same risk or otherwise establish an equivalent position.    Grouping economically-substitutable swaps together makes the setting of appropriate minimum block sizes on an individual product basis unnecessary and potentially dangerous in that it would allow for like risks to trade differently.c. Block Methodology Alternatives    The Commission also considered various alternatives to its proposed methodologies for determining appropriate minimum block thresholds in both the initial and the post initial periods. As discussed more fully in Section II.B., the Commission received various comments suggesting alternatives to the phased-in approach contained in the Further Block Proposal. Many commenters compared the 67 percent notional amount calculation to a 50 percent notional amount calculation, as specifically requested by the Commission in Question 33 of the Further Block Proposal. Twelve commenters preferred the 67 percent notional amount calculation to a 50 percent notional amount calculation; whereas, nine commenters preferred the 50 percent notional amount calculation to the 67 percent notional amount calculation. ODEX, RJ O'Brien, and Spring Trading expressed support for the 67 percent notional amount calculation, but also suggested that a higher notional amount calculation would be preferable, particularly in the post-initial period.\\625\n",
      " ~~# index: 624|| AFR, Better Markets, Javelin, and SDMA all recommended a 75 percent or higher notional amount calculation and a market depth and market breadth test.\\626\n",
      " ~~# index: 625||     Nine commenters preferred the 50 percent notional amount calculation to the 67 percent notional amount calculation.    Freddie Mac and ICI expressly supported a 50 percent notional amount calculation.\\627\n",
      " ~~# index: 626|| Pierpont and WMBAA recommended a notional amount calculation of no greater than 50 percent.\\628\n",
      " ~~# index: 627|| ICAP Energy and SIFMA recommended a notional amount calculation below 50 percent, but preferred a 50 percent notional amount calculation to a 67 percent notional amount calculation.\\629\n",
      " ~~# index: 628|| AII and ICAP recommended not using a notional amount calculation at all, but preferred a 50 percent notional amount calculation to a 67 percent notional amount calculation.\\630\n",
      " ~~# index: 629||     AII recommended lowering or eliminating block thresholds until complete data has been reported to SDRs so as not to impair market liquidity.\\631\n",
      " ~~# index: 630|| Barclays recommended introducing block levels that allow for empirical analysis of the transaction data and sequentially increasing block sizes until such point as the desired equilibrium between transparency and liquidity is reached.\\632\n",
      " ~~# index: 631|| Better Markets suggested transitioning to a market depth/market breadth test after the Commission has collected a year of SDR data.\\633\n",
      " ~~# index: 632||     The Commission also specifically requested comments regarding other potential methods for determining appropriate minimum block thresholds.\\634\n",
      " ~~# index: 633|| While numerous comments addressed the efficacy of a notional amount calculation and the appropriate percentage to use in making such a calculation, the comments reveal only one significant alternative methodology to calculating relevant initial and post-initial minimum block thresholds in place of a notional amount calculation: block thresholds based on market depth and market breadth.\\635\n",
      " ~~# index: 634|| The Commission received a number of comments regarding whether the Commission should use either market depth or market breadth criteria, instead of the 67-percent notional amount calculation methodology, to calculate the relevant initial minimum block sizes and the post-initial minimum block sizes.\\636\n",
      " ~~# index: 635|| Many commenters expressed support for adopting the market depth test \\637\n",
      " ~~# index: 636|| and other commenters additionally supported utilizing the market breadth test.\\638\n",
      " ~~# index: 637||     As discussed more fully in Section II.B., for the initial period the Commission is adopting the 50 percent notional amount calculation to determine appropriate minimum block sizes in the interest rate and credit asset classes. This approach provides for a more gradual phase-in of minimum block sizes, as recommended by numerous commenters. The Commission believes that the phase-in approach should provide swap market participants with an adequate amount of time to incrementally adjust their trading practices, technology infrastructure and business arrangements to comply with the new block trade regime.    For the post-initial period, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.6(f)(1) as proposed. The 67-percent notional amount calculation means that, within a swap category, approximately two-thirds of the sum total of all notional amounts will be reported on a real-time basis. This approach will afford market participants a timely view of a substantial portion of swap transaction and pricing data to assist them in determining the competitive price for swaps within a relevant swap category. The Commission anticipates that this enhanced price transparency will encourage market participants to provide liquidity (e.g., through the posting of bids and offers), particularly when transaction prices move away from the competitive price. The Commission also anticipates that enhanced price transparency thereby will improve market integrity and price discovery, while also reducing information asymmetries enjoyed by market makers in predominately opaque swap markets.\\639\n",
      " ~~# index: 638||     In the Commission's view, using the 67-percent notional amount calculation also would minimize the potential impact of real-time public reporting on liquidity risk compared to other alternatives. The 67 percent notional amount calculation represents a middle ground between the many commenters who supported higher block thresholds and the many commenters who preferred much more conservative thresholds. The Commission believes that its methodology, in conjunction with the 50-percent notional amount calculation during the initial period, represents a tailored and incremental approach for achieving the goal of ``a vast majority'' of swap transactions becoming subject to real-time public reporting.\\640\n",
      " ~~# index: 639||     As noted above, CEA section 2(a)(13)(E)(iv) directs the Commission to take into account whether the public disclosure of swap transaction and pricing data ``will materially reduce market liquidity.'' \\641\n",
      " ~~# index: 640|| activity and how block sizes affect market liquidity in each of the specified swap categories.\\642\n",
      " ~~# index: 641||     The Commission acknowledges that the market depth and market breadth test is a viable alternative to the notional amount calculation methodology. However, it has several prerequisite conditions that complicate the ability to implement it. For example, the Commission would need to determine which contracts within a swap category offer pre-trade price transparency--electronically displayed and executable bids and offers as well as displayed available volumes for execution. As noted by commenters, adequate market trading data also must be available to collect a market depth snapshot of all of the bids and offers for the pre-trade price transparency set of applicable contracts. The Commission is also cognizant of MFA's concerns regarding the potential for manipulation of market depth. Given the time needed for trading infrastructure to develop and the significant time and cost considerations involved in collecting such data from SEFs and DCMs, the Commission deems it unfeasible to implement at this time; the Commission will continue to examine the merits of doing so in the future.6. CEA Section 15(a) Factorsa. Protection of Market Participants and the Public    The Commission believes that the criteria and methodology in Sec.  43.6(a)-(f) and (h) will protect swap market participants by extending the delay for reporting for publicly reportable swap transactions, as appropriate, while also accommodating the market participant and public interest with enhanced transparency. By setting appropriate minimum block sizes in a thoughtful and measured manner as contemplated in the final rule, the Commission believes that it has properly balanced the tradeoff between transparency and liquidity interests. As a result, swap market participants will retain a means to offset risk exposures related to their swap transactions at competitive prices. In addition, the phased-in implementation scheme outlined in this rulemaking will introduce greater transparency in an incremental, measured and flexible manner so that appropriate minimum block sizes are responsive to changing markets. Specifically, the Commission expects that the availability of real-time pricing information for carefully enumerated categories of swap transactions will draw increased swap market liquidity through the competitive appeal of improved pricing efficiency that greater transparency affords. More liquid, competitive swap markets, in turn, allow businesses to offset costs more efficiently than in completely opaque markets, thus serving the interests of both market participants and the public who should benefit through lower costs of goods and services.    Another benefit of increasing swaps market transparency to regulators and the public in real-time, without the interim delays for all transactions imposed in Part 43, is better protection of market participants and the public by improving the Commission's oversight ability and by giving academics, the media, public and market participants the opportunity to monitor, study, and analyze these previously opaque segments of the economy.b. Efficiency, Competitiveness and Financial Integrity of Markets \\643\n",
      " ~~# index: 642||     The criteria and methodology set out in the rules will promote market efficiency, competitiveness and financial integrity of markets in several ways. The Commission acknowledges that because responsibility for specifying swap categories and determining appropriate minimum block sizes is with the Commission rather than registered entities, the administrative burden on swap market participants is minimized. Further, the rules afford flexibility to respond to continuing swaps market evolution, including but not limited to changing industry practices and activities that the Commission foresees occurring as market participants comply with regulations, including part 43, implementing the Dodd-Frank Act regulatory regime. More specifically, the methodology in Sec.  43.6(c)-(f) and (h) will recalibrate appropriate minimum block sizes regularly to ensure that those sizes remain appropriate for, and responsive to, these changing markets. This ability, coupled with the potential for the Commission to adjust futures block requirements in pending and future rulemakings (among other tools) also helps assure that competitive implications that could arise between substitutable swaps and futures as markets evolve are appropriately addressed. The Commission believes that the rules will introduce increased market transparency for swaps in a careful, measured manner that the Commission believes will optimize the balance between liquidity and transparency concerns.\\644\n",
      " ~~# index: 643||     Section 43.6(g) specifies the process for a market participant to elect that a swap transaction be treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap (``the election process''). Section 43.6(g)(1) establishes a two-step notification process relating to block trades. Section 43.6(g)(2) establishes the notification process relating to large notional off-facility swaps.    Section 43.6(g)(1)(i) sets out the first step in the block trade notification process: parties to a swap executed at or above the appropriate minimum block size for the applicable swap category are required to notify the SEF or DCM, as applicable, of their election to have their qualifying swap transaction treated as a block trade. Section 43.6(g)(1)(ii) sets out the second step: the SEF or DCM, as applicable, that receives an election notification is required to notify an SDR of a block trade election when transmitting swap transaction and pricing data to such SDR for public dissemination. The Commission expects SEFs and DCMs to use automated, electronic--and in some cases voice--processes to execute swap transactions; the transmission of the notification of a block trade election, which may occur separately from the execution process, also will be either automated, electronic or communicated through voice processes.    Section 43.6(g)(1)(ii) sets out the second step: the SEF or DCM, as applicable, that receives an election notification is required to notify an SDR of a block trade election when transmitting swap transaction and pricing data to such SDR for public dissemination.1. Costs Relevant to the Election Process (Sec.  43.6(g))    Non-financial end-users who are reporting parties, as well as SEFs, DCMs, and SDRs will likely bear the costs of complying with the election process in Sec.  43.6(g). To comply with the real-time reporting requirements of part 43 already in place, these entities will have already invested in technology and personnel as well as established programs for continued systems maintenance, support and compliance; the Commission has previously described and considered these costs in the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule.\\645\n",
      " ~~# index: 644|| The Commission specifically designed the election process so that non-financial end-users, SEFs, DCMs, and SDRs would be able to leverage any investments made for compliance with part 43 to also comply with Sec.  43.6(g). Accordingly, the Commission expects non-financial end-users, SEFs, DCMs and SDRs to have the following direct, quantifiable costs: (a) An incremental, non-recurring expenditure to update existing technology to comply with Sec.  43.6(g); (b) an incremental non-recurring expenditure for training existing personnel and updating written policies and procedures for compliance with amendments to part 43; (c) incremental recurring expenses associated with compliance, maintenance and operational support in connection with the election process; and (d) additional incremental, non-recurring expenditures to update existing technology exclusive to SDRs.

      " ~~# index: 655|| 3. Benefits Relevant to the Election Process (Sec.  43.6(g))    The Commission has identified two overarching benefits that the election process in Sec.  43.6(g) would confer on swap market participants, registered entities and the general public. First, although Sec.  43.6(g) sets out a purely administrative process with which market participants and registered entities must comply, the Commission views this process as an integral component of the block trade framework in this rulemaking and in part 43. Consequently, this election process will benefit market participants, registered entities and the general public by providing greater price transparency in swaps markets than currently exists under part 43.\\657\n",
      " ~~# index: 656||     Second, the Commission believes that the election process will promote market efficiency by creating a standardized process in Sec.  43.6(g) for market participants to designate publicly reportable swap transactions that are eligible for block trade or large notional off-facility swap treatment. In addition, this standardized process will further promote efficiency by allowing market participants and registered entities to leverage their existing technology infrastructure, connectivity, personnel and other resources required under parts 43 and 49 of the Commission's regulations. The Commission believes the final rule avoids imposing duplicative or conflicting obligations on market participants and registered entities.4. Alternatives    The Commission specifically asked commenters whether there were alternative methods through which a reporting party could elect to treat its qualifying swap transaction as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. In addition, the Commission asked whether it should require a variation on the proposed election process where SEFs, DCMs, and reporting parties would be required to indicate under which swap category they were claiming block or large notional off-facility swap treatment. Finally, the Commission asked whether it should establish an alternative approach for small end-users when such an end-user is the reporting party to a qualified swap transaction.    No comments were received either proposing or otherwise supporting an alternative approach and as such, the Commission is adopting in Sec.  43.6(g) relative to possible alternatives.5. Application of the Section 15(a) Factors to Sec.  43.6(g)a. Protection of Market Participants and the Public    Section 43.6(g) is an essential part of this rulemaking because it provides the mechanism through which market participants will be able to elect to treat their qualifying swap transaction as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap. Consequently, this process contributes to providing greater swap market transparency than what currently exists under part 43 of the Commission's regulations. Market participants, registered entities and the general public benefit from this enhanced swap market price transparency.b. Efficiency, Competitiveness and Financial Integrity.\\658\n",
      " ~~# index: 657||     This section discusses the two amendments to Sec.  43.4. Section 43.4 as now promulgated prescribes the manner in which SDRs must publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data. One amendment adds a system for masking the geographical data for certain swaps in the other commodity asset class not currently subject to public dissemination, which provides limited, but not detailed information on the geographic location of the underlying assets of those swaps. The other amendment establishes a methodology to establish cap sizes that masks the size of swap transactions above a certain threshold, which is different from the methodology for determining appropriate minimum block sizes. Both amendments seek to protect the anonymity of the parties and certain identifying information for swaps while also providing increased transparency in swaps markets.1. Amendments to Sec.  43.4(d)(4)    The Commission addresses the public dissemination of information regarding certain swaps in the other commodity asset class in Sec.  43.4(d)(4). Section 43.4(d)(4)(ii) currently provides that for publicly reportable swaps in this commodity asset class, information identifying the underlying assets of the swap must be publicly disseminated for: (a) those swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF or DCM; (b) those swaps referencing one of the contracts described in appendix B to part 43; and (c) any publicly reportable swap transaction that is economically related to one of the contracts described in appendix B to part 43. Pursuant to the Real-Time Reporting Final Rule, any swap that is in the other commodity asset class that falls under Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii) will be subject to reporting and public dissemination requirements.    In this final rule, the Commission is adopting a new provision, Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii), that prescribes a system for the public dissemination of exact underlying assets in the other commodity asset class with a ``mask'' for sensitive and potentially revealing geographic detail. The Commission also is adopting guidance in the form of a new appendix to part 43 that contains the geographical details that SDRs will be able to use in masking eligible other commodity swaps while maintaining compliance with public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data.2. Amendments to Sec.  43.4(h)    Section 43.4(h) establishes cap sizes for ``rounded notional or principal swap amounts'' above which information on swaps transactions is publicly reportable, for the purpose of providing anonymity for transactions where information on the notional or principal amounts alone would likely reveal the identity of the parties to the swap or sensitive business information. In doing so, the Commission notes that the objective of establishing cap sizes differs from that of establishing appropriate minimum block sizes.\\659\n",
      " ~~# index: 658||     Section 43.4(h) currently requires SDRs to publicly disseminate the notional or principal amounts of a publicly reportable swap transaction represented by a cap size (i.e., $XX+) that adjusts in accordance with the respective appropriate minimum block size for the relevant swap category. Section 43.4(h) further provides that if no appropriate minimum block size exists with respect to a swap category, then the cap size on the notional or principal amount will correspond with interim cap sizes that the Commission has established for the five asset classes.\\660\n",
      " ~~# index: 659||     The amendment to Sec.  43.4(h) will require SDRs to continue to publicly disseminate cap sizes that correspond to their respective appropriate minimum block sizes during the initial period. However, when the Commission publishes the post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes in accordance with Sec.  43.6(f), it will also publish post-initial cap sizes for each swap category by applying a 75-percent notional amount calculation on data collected by SDRs. The Commission will apply the 75-percent notional amount calculation to a one-year rolling window of such data corresponding to each relevant swap category for each calendar year.3. Costs Relevant to the Amendments to Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and (h)    SDRs will bear some costs of complying with the amendments to Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and (h).\\661\n",
      " ~~# index: 660||     The Commission anticipates that these entities already will have made non-recurring expenditures in technology and personnel in connection with the requirements set forth in part 43 and part 49 (which contain rules regarding the registration and regulation of SDRs).

      " ~~# index: 661|| Notwithstanding these recurring expenses, an SDR will have additional non-recurring expenditures associated with the amendments to Sec.  43.4.

      " ~~# index: 662||     The Commission is revising its estimates based on updated wage rate data. The Commission estimates the updated approximate cost required to amend internal procedures, reprogram systems and implement processes to capture and publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data for block trades and large notional off-facility swaps in compliance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  43.4(d) to be $2,930 for each SDR.\\664\n",
      " ~~# index: 663||     In addition, the Commission believes that Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) will result in some incremental, recurring costs for SDRs because they will be required to publicly disseminate other commodity swaps data that were not previously within the scope of the public dissemination requirement in Sec.  43.4. The Commission estimates that there will be approximately 50,000 additional swaps reported to an SDR each year in the other commodity asset class, which the Commission estimates will be $154,021 in annualized costs.\\665\n",
      " ~~# index: 664||     The Commission also anticipates that Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii) will result in some indirect costs to the market through reduced information, since notional values of transactions beyond the cap size limits will not be revealed to the public. The Commission lacks data to quantify the costs associated with the reduction of information. However, given the statutory mandate to protect market participant identities, the Commission believes such costs are warranted and contemplated by Congress.    The Commission also received a number of comments regarding potential costs arising from the established level for cap size. GFMA stated that the same rationale should apply to cap and block sizes, as both have potential negative impacts on liquidity.\\666\n",
      " ~~# index: 665|| ICI stated that the 75 percent notional amount would be too high for determining cap size because the lack of depth and liquidity in the swaps market could cause public reporting of block sizes to reveal identities, business transactions, and market positions of participants, and recommends a 67 percent notional amount calculation for determining cap size in the post-initial period.\\667\n",
      " ~~# index: 666|| ISDA/SIFMA stated that the added transparency from reporting transaction sizes between 67 percent and 75 percent would be outweighed by the harm to liquidity from additional disclosure, and urges the Commission to ensure that the post-initial cap size is always equal to the relevant block size.\\668\n",
      " ~~# index: 667|| MFA stated that it is unnecessary for the Commission to establish cap sizes that differ from minimum block sizes as there is not a meaningful transparency benefit that would outweigh the resource burdens on the Commission, SDRs, SEFs, and other market participants.\\669\n",

Benefits Relevant to the Amendments to Sec.  43.4    The Commission anticipates that the anonymity provisions of Sec.  43.4 will generate several overarching benefits to swap market participants, registered entities and the general public. In the first instance, the Commission anticipates that the cap size amendments to Sec.  43.4(h) will benefit market participants, registered entities and the general public by providing greater price transparency with respect to swaps with notional amounts that fall between the post-initial appropriate minimum block size and post-initial cap size for a particular swap category. During the post-initial period, the Commission will set appropriate minimum block sizes based on the 67 percent notional amount calculation \\673\n",

      " ~~# index: 674|| 5. Alternatives    The Commission received numerous comments supporting alternatives to the proposed anonymity provisions in Sec.  43.4(d)(4) and (h). These alternatives fall into two basic categories: (1) Post-initial cap size level; and (2) preventing public disclosure of swap market participant identity. In regard to cap size, seven commenters recommended that the Commission set post-initial cap sizes matching the minimum block size thresholds established by the Commission. AII supported setting the post-initial cap size for each swap category at the same level as the block size threshold and states that the 75 percent notional amount calculation is far too high.\\676\n",
      " ~~# index: 675||     For the initial period, AII and ISDA/SIFMA argued that the cap size should be the lower of block size and the interim cap size in Sec.  43.4(h)(1).\\677\n",
      " ~~# index: 676|| Barclays recommended that the post initial period cap sizes be introduced at more nuanced levels that reflect the differences between product's traded volumes.\\678\n",
      " ~~# index: 677|| EEI stated that the initial cap size of $25 million for both the Electricity Swap Contracts and the Other Commodity Electricity Swap Category is too high, as is the 75 percent notional amount for the post-initial period. EEI recommended that the Commission adopt a fixed cap size of $3 million for both periods.\\679\n",
      " ~~# index: 678||     The Commission has evaluated these various alternatives concerning post-initial cap size levels against the statutory requirements imposed upon it by Section 2(a)(13): bring real-time public reporting to the swaps market subject to time delays for block trades and large notional off-facility swaps that it determines appropriate.\\680\n",
      " ~~# index: 679||     The additional information provided to the market regarding the size of block trades that are below the cap size may enhance price discovery by publicly disseminating more information relating to market depth and the notional sizes of publicly reportable swap transactions. This, in turn, promotes increased market liquidity.    In regard to alternatives for preventing the public disclosure of the identities of swap market participants, the Commission received three comments regarding the masking of specific delivery or pricing detail of energy and power swaps. EEI recommended that the Commission mask data regarding Other Commodity Electricity Swaps according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation eight regions rather than the FERC regions proposed.\\681\n",
      " ~~# index: 680|| Barclays recommended that the Commission use wider geographic regions when publicly disseminating data for commodity swaps with very specific underlying assets and/or delivery points and develop an appropriate process to avoid identifying issuers of debt.\\682\n",
      " ~~# index: 681||     After consideration of the alternatives suggested by commenters, the Commission is adopting Sec.  43.4(d)(iii) with the following modification that it believes affords greater anonymity protection relative to the Further Block Proposal, without adversely impacting transparency. The modification is: For publicly reportable swap transactions that have electricity and sources as an underlying asset and have a specific delivery or pricing point in the United States, the Commission is requiring SDRs to public disseminate the specific delivery or pricing point based on a description of one of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (``NERC'') regions for publicly disseminating delivery or pricing points for electricity swaps described in proposed Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(iii). Using the regions suggested by EEI further masks specific delivery details and thus provides additional protection against public disclosure of identities, business transactions, and market positions of swap market participants, as recommended by Barclays and Spring Trading.    The Commission also considered the alternative of having DCMs and SEFs set cap sizes. The Commission ultimately chose to determine cap sizes itself for the reason that doing so limits the direct burden on registered entities to determine and implement appropriate cap sizes themselves. As such, the chosen approach will promote market efficiency for market participants and registered entities.6. Application of the Section 15(a) Factors to the Amendments to Sec.  43.4a. Protection of Market Participants and the Public    The amendments to Sec.  43.4 protect swap counterparty anonymity on an ongoing basis. While cap sizes for some transactions can exceed appropriate minimum block sizes in certain circumstances (resulting in the public dissemination of notional/principal-amount information after a time delay), the Commission believes that for the vast majority of impacted swap transactions, the cap-size process and methodology is sufficient to distinguish correctly between those for which masking of notional or principal amount is required to maintain anonymity and those for which it is not.\\683\n",
      " ~~# index: 682|| b. Efficiency, Competitiveness and Financial Integrity \\684\n",
      " ~~# index: 683||     The Commission believes that amendments to Sec.  43.4(h) promote market efficiencies and competitiveness since the approach will provide market participants with the ability to continue transacting swaps with the protection of anonymity, while promoting greater price transparency.    The Commission does not believe that the implementation of the anonymity protections established in Sec.  43.4(h) will adversely impact the financial integrity of swap markets. The Commission has considered the comments provided regarding impacts on liquidity arising out of the 75 percent notional cap size. The Commission does not agree that the cap size will have a substantial negative impact on market liquidity. As stated above, the additional pricing information available to the market as a result of the 75 percent notional cap size promotes enhanced price discovery by publicly disseminating more information relating to market depth and the notional sizes of publicly reportable swap transactions, while still protecting the anonymity of swap counterparties and their ability to lay off risk when executing extraordinarily large swap transactions. This, in turn, promotes market liquidity.c. Price Discovery    The cap size amendments to Sec.  43.4(h) should benefit market participants, registered entities and the general public by providing greater price transparency with respect to swaps with notional amounts that fall between the post-initial appropriate minimum block size and post-initial cap size for a particular swap category. During the post-initial period, the Commission will set appropriate minimum block sizes based on the 67 percent notional amount calculation \\685\n",
      " ~~# index: 684|| and cap sizes based on the 75-percent notional amount calculation.\\686\n",
      " ~~# index: 685||     Section 43.6(h)(6) specifies that, except as otherwise provided, it is impermissible to aggregate orders for different accounts in order to satisfy minimum block trade or cap size requirements. The rule further provides that aggregation may be permitted on a DCM or SEF if done by a person who: (i)(A) is a CTA who is registered pursuant to Section 4n of the Act or is exempt from registration under the Act, or a principal thereof, and has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts, (B) is an investment adviser who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria of Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of the Commission's regulations, or (C) is a foreign person who performs a role or function similar to the persons described in (A) or (B) and is subject as such to foreign regulation, and (ii) has more than $25,000,000 in total AUM.1. Overview of Comments Received    The Commission received a number of comments with the proposed aggregation rule but none directly addressing the costs and benefits considerations of the rule.    JP Morgan commented that the rule appears to reflect a concern that private negotiation affords less protection to unsophisticated investors than trading through the central markets, and that since all entities that transact in the OTC market already must be ECPs, the analogous concern about customer protection in the swaps market is already addressed.\\687\n",
      " ~~# index: 686||     ICI opposed the minimum assets under management requirement in proposed Sec.  43.6(h)(6)(ii) and argued that the Commission did not articulate a rationale or policy reason for this requirement.\\688\n",
      " ~~# index: 687|| ICI also disagreed that an investment adviser seeking to aggregate orders must satisfy the criteria of Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of the Commission's regulations.\\689\n",
      " ~~# index: 688||     With respect to JP Morgan's comment, the Commission notes that customers trading swaps on DCMs do not have to be ECPs. As discussed further below, adopted Sec.  43.6(i)(1) allows non-ECP customers to be parties to block trades through a qualifying CTA, investment adviser, or similar foreign person.\\690\n",
      " ~~# index: 689||     In response to ICI's opposition to the minimum asset threshold under Sec.  43.6(h)(6)(ii), the Commission notes that this threshold reflects common industry practice.\\691\n",
      " ~~# index: 690|| in its rules since September 2000.\\692\n",
      " ~~# index: 691|| CME has stated that the threshold ``is an effort to establish the professionalism and sophistication of the registrant'' \\693\n",

      " ~~# index: 693||     The Commission also disagrees with ICI's contention that investment advisers should not be required to satisfy the criteria under Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v), which requires an investment adviser to (1) be registered and active as an investment adviser for two years or (2) provide securities investment advice to securities accounts which, in the aggregate, have total assets in excess of $5 million deposited at one or more registered securities brokers.\\695\n",
      " ~~# index: 694|| The Commission first adopted provisions similar to current Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) in 1992 \\696\n",
      " ~~# index: 695|| as objective indications that a person had the investment sophistication and experience needed to evaluate the risks and benefits of investing in commodity pools or a portfolio large enough to indicate the same, along with the financial resources to withstand the investment risks.\\697\n",

      " ~~# index: 697|| the Commission extended the same criteria in current Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) to registered investment advisers for the same reasons.\\699\n",
      " ~~# index: 698|| 1. Overview of Comments Received    The Commission received few comments with respect to the eligible block trade parties rule. As discussed above, similar comments regarding the exceptions to the prohibitions against aggregation for certain persons were submitted with respect to the exception to certain persons transacting blocks on a DCM on behalf of non-ECPs. For example, ICI opposed the minimum assets under management requirement in proposed Sec.  43.6(i)(1) and similarly argued that the Commission did not articulate a rationale or policy reason for this requirement.\\700\n",
      " ~~# index: 699||     The Commission received one specific comment related to costs on proposed Sec.  43.6(i)(2). SIFMA commented that proposed Sec.  43.6(i)(2) may require asset managers to obtain consent from each client for whom they will engage in block trades.\\701\n",
      " ~~# index: 700|| SIFMA contended that this requirement would be costly and unnecessary, and that notice to the customers \\702\n",
      " ~~# index: 701|| or a general grant of investment discretion in the investment management agreement, power of attorney, or similar document should be sufficient.\\703\n",
      " ~~# index: 702||     The Commission disagrees with SIFMA's contention regarding the burdens of obtaining consent. This burden consent will be minimal because Sec.  43.6(i)(2) states that the instruction or consent may be provided through a power of attorney or similar document that provides discretionary trading authority or the authority to direct trading in the account. The consent may therefore be included in existing and future customer agreements. The Commission further disagrees that a general grant of investment discretion or notice to the customer should satisfy Sec.  43.6(i)(2). A customer's written instruction or consent is necessary because a customer potentially may not receive the best terms for an individual swap transaction that is part of an aggregation. The written instruction or consent makes the customer aware that block trades may be used on its behalf, allowing the customer to decide whether to allow these transactions, through which the rule has the added benefit of protection of market participants and public. The Commission also would like to point out that a cost estimate for that burden has already been presented in the proposed rule and received no direct comments on that cost estimate.2. Costs    Section 43.6(i)(1) requires that parties to a block trade must be eligible contract participants, as defined under the CEA and Commission regulations, except that a DCM may allow: (i) A CTA registered pursuant to Section 4n of the Act or exempt from registration under the Act, or a principal thereof, and who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts, (ii) an investment adviser who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria of Sec.  4.7(a)(2)(v) of the Commission's regulations, or (iii) a foreign person who performs a similar role or function to the persons described in (i) or (ii) and is subject as such to foreign regulation, to transact block trades for customers who are not eligible contract participants, if such CTA, investment adviser or foreign person has more than $25,000,000 in total AUM. This rule codifies, in part, the requirement under Section 2(e) of the CEA, which requires that ``[i]t shall be unlawful for any person, other than an eligible contract participant, to enter into a swap unless the swap is entered into on, or subject to the rules of[hellip].a designated contract market.'' In addition, the provisions allowing certain entities (as described in this release) to enter into block trades on behalf of their non-ECP customers on DCMs is substantially similar to the existing DCM rules that allow block trading in the futures market.    Section 43.6(i)(2) further provides that no person may conduct a block trade on behalf of a customer unless the person receives prior written instruction or consent to do so. The rule further provides that such instruction or consent may be provided in the power of attorney or similar document by which the customer provides the person with discretionary trading authority or the authority to direct the trading in its account. The Commission is of the view that the cost associated with the written instruction or consent is minimal. The Commission estimates that a prior written instruction or consent requirement would impose an initial non-recurring burden of approximately 2 personnel hours at an approximate cost of $155.54 for each CTA, investment adviser or foreign person.\\704\n",
      " ~~# index: 703||     The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'') requires Federal agencies to consider the impact of its rules on ``small entities.'' \\705\n",
      " ~~# index: 704|| A regulatory flexibility analysis or certification typically is required for ``any rule for which the agency publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to'' the notice-and-comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b).\\706\n",
      " ~~# index: 705|| With respect to the Further Block Proposal, the Commission provided in its RFA statement that the proposed rule would have a direct effect on a number of entities, specifically DCMs, SEFs, SDs, MSPs, and certain single end-users.\\707\n",
      " ~~# index: 706||     In the Further Block Proposal, the Commission provided that it previously had established that certain entities subject to its jurisdiction are not small entities for purposes of the RFA. Specifically, the Commission stated that it had previously determined that SEFs and DCMs are not small businesses.\\708\n",
      " ~~# index: 707|| The Commission also stated that it is of the view that SDs and MSPs are not small businesses.\\709\n",
      " ~~# index: 708||     The Commission recognized that the proposed rule could impose direct burdens on parties to a swap, which the Commission has determined previously may include a percentage of small end users that are considered small businesses for the purposes of the RFA.\\710\n",
      " ~~# index: 709||     Notwithstanding the imposition of this burden, however, the determination to certify pursuant to Sec.  605(b) of the RFA that the proposed rule would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities was based upon two major considerations. First, Section 43.3 of the Commission's regulations already requires these entities to report their swap transaction and pricing data to an SDR.\\711\n"

      " ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 518|| hedging needs increase. If a bona fide hedger seeks an exemption for anticipated commercial production or anticipatory commercial requirements, then the hedger would submit a 404A filing pursuant to Sec.  151.5(c).    Under the Proposed Rules, 404 and 404S filings would have been required on a daily basis. In light of comments concerning the burden of daily filings to both market participants and the Commission, the final regulations require only monthly reporting of 404 and 404S filings. These monthly reports would provide information on daily positions for the month reporting period.    The Commission estimated in the Proposed Rules that these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements would affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $37.6 million across all of these entities, 168,000 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $13.2 million in annual labor costs and $25.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. As a result of modifications made to the Proposed Rules, under the final regulations these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements will affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $28.6 million across all of these entities, 29,700 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $2.3 million in annual labor costs and $26.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404 filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404 filing requirements would affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404 filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404A filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404A filing requirements would affect approximately sixty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 6,000 total annual labor hours and $4.2 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In addition to adjustments in these estimates stemming from the change in the frequency of filings, the estimate of entities affected by 404A filing requirements has been modified to reflect the fact that the final regulations include certain anticipatory hedging exemptions that were absent from the Proposed Rules. Thus, under the final regulations, 404A filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 2,700 total annual labor hours and $6.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404S filings, under the Proposed Rules the Commission estimated that 404S filing requirements would affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 54,000 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404S filing requirements will affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,200 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Section 151.5(e) specifies recordkeeping requirements for traders who claim bona fide hedge exemptions. These recordkeeping requirements include complete books and records concerning all of their related cash, futures, and swap positions and transactions and make such books and records, along with a list of swap counterparties to the Commission. Regulations 151.5(g) and 151.5(h) provide procedural documentation requirements for those availing themselves of a bona fide hedging transaction exemption. These firms would be required to document a representation and confirmation by at least one party that the swap counterparty is relying on a bona fide hedge exemption, along with a confirmation of receipt by the other party to the swap. Paragraph (h) of Sec.  151.5 also requires that the written representation and confirmation be retained by the parties and available to the Commission upon request.\\519\n",

      " ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 519||     Section 151.6 requires traders with positions exceeding visibility levels in Referenced Contracts in metal and energy commodities to submit additional information about cash market and derivatives activity in substantially the same commodity. Section 151.6(b) requires the submission of a 401 filing which would provide basic position information on the position exceeding the visibility level. Section151.6(c) requires additional information, through a 402S filing, on a trader's uncleared swaps in substantially the same commodity. The Commission has determined to increase the visibility levels from the proposed levels, meaning fewer market participants will be affected by the relevant reporting requirements. In addition, the Proposed Rules included a requirement to submit 404A filings under proposed Sec.  151.6, but the Commission has eliminated this requirement in order to reduce the compliance burden for firms reporting under Sec.  151.6.    Requirements under 401 filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately one hundred forty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,800 total annual labor hours and $15.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, these requirements will affect approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 8,400 total annual labor hours and $5.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Requirements under 402S filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 5,600 total annual labor hours and $4.9 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, the Commission has eliminated the 402S filing, thus eliminating any burden stemming from such reports.

      " ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 175||     With respect to the reduction of the timeframe in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) for an FCM to incur a capital charge for undermargined customer accounts, the Commission has considered the comments and has determined to adopt the amendments as proposed. The timely collection of margin is a critical component of an FCM's risk management program and is intended to ensure that an FCM holds sufficient funds deposited by customers to meet their potential obligations to a DCO. As guarantor of the financial performance of the customer accounts that it carries, the FCM is financially responsible if the owner of an account cannot meet its margin obligations to the FCM and ultimately to a DCO.    The timeframe for meeting margin calls currently provided in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) was established in the 1970s when the use of checks and the mail system were more prevalent for depositing margin with an FCM. However, in today's markets, with the increasing use of technology, 24-hour-a-day trading, and the use of wire transfers to meet margin obligations, the Commission believes that the timeframe for taking a capital charge should be reduced both to give an incentive to FCMs to exercise prudent risk management and to strengthen the financial protections of FCMs, and to enhance the safety of the clearing systems and other customers by requiring FCMs to reserve capital for undermargined customer accounts that fail to meet a margin call on a timely basis.    Several commenters have stated that the proposal would harm customers by increasing costs to customers or by exposing more of the customers' funds to the FCM.\\176\n",

      " ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 176|| proposed. As noted above, Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(ix) applies to noncustomers and omnibus accounts carried by an FCM. Many of the concerns raised by the comments regarding the ability to fund a margin call under Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) do not apply to accounts held by an affiliate or an omnibus accounts. Such accounts should pay margin calls promptly and by wire transfer to reduce the potential exposure to the FCM resulting from undermargined accounts.    The Commission also believes that the amendments to Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) and (ix) are appropriate even if the Commission amends its regulations to require an FCM to maintain residual interest in segregated accounts in excess of the undermargined amount of customer accounts. The purpose of the capital rule is to ensure that an FCM maintains sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations as a going concern. Proprietary funds held in segregated accounts that exceed the total obligation to customers are included in an FCM's capital computation. However, in situations where the FCM's residual interest in segregated accounts is covering an undermargined customer account, a capital charge is appropriate because the FCM's residual interest is necessary to cover potential market losses on the undermargined accounts.3. Permit an FCM That Is Not a BD To Develop Policies and Procedures To Determine Creditworthiness    The Commissions proposed to amend Sec.  1.17(c)(v) to permit an FCM that is not a BD to develop a framework to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures for determining creditworthiness of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable. In recommending the proposal, the Commission noted that the SEC proposed to permit a BD to establish written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable.\\177\n",

      " ### ERROR CHUNK ###, index: 177||     Under both the Commission's proposal and the SEC's proposal, an FCM or BD would assess the security's credit risk using the following factors, to the extent appropriate:    <bullet> Credit spreads (i.e., whether it is possible to demonstrate that a position in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock is subject to a minimal amount of credit risk based on the spread between the security's yield and the yield of Treasury or other securities, or based on credit default swap spreads that reference the security);    <bullet> Securities-related research (i.e., whether providers of securities-related research believe the issuer of the security will be able to meet its financial commitments, generally, or specifically, with respect to securities held by the FCM or BD);    <bullet> Internal or external credit risk assessments (i.e., whether credit assessments developed internally by the FCM or BD or externally by a credit rating agency, irrespective of its status as an NRSRO, express a view as to the credit risk associated with a particular security);    <bullet> Default statistics (i.e., whether providers of credit information relating to securities express a view that specific securities have a probability of default consistent with other securities with a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Inclusion on an index (i.e., whether a security, or issuer of the security, is included as a component of a recognized index of instruments that are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Priorities and enhancements (i.e., the extent to which a security is covered by credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization and reserve accounts, or has priority under applicable bankruptcy or creditors' rights provisions);    <bullet> Price, yield and/or volume (i.e., whether the price and yield of a security or a credit default swap that references the security are consistent with other securities that the FCM or BD has determined are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk and whether the price resulted from active trading); and    <bullet> Asset class-specific factors (e.g., in the case of structured finance products, the quality of the underlying assets).

Under the Proposed Rules, 404 and 404S filings would have been required on a daily basis. In light of comments concerning the burden of daily filings to both market participants and the Commission, the final regulations require only monthly reporting of 404 and 404S filings. These monthly reports would provide information on daily positions for the month reporting period.    The Commission estimated in the Proposed Rules that these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements would affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $37.6 million across all of these entities, 168,000 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $13.2 million in annual labor costs and $25.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. As a result of modifications made to the Proposed Rules, under the final regulations these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements will affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $28.6 million across all of these entities, 29,700 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $2.3 million in annual labor costs and $26.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404 filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404 filing requirements would affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404 filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404A filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404A filing requirements would affect approximately sixty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 6,000 total annual labor hours and $4.2 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In addition to adjustments in these estimates stemming from the change in the frequency of filings, the estimate of entities affected by 404A filing requirements has been modified to reflect the fact that the final regulations include certain anticipatory hedging exemptions that were absent from the Proposed Rules. Thus, under the final regulations, 404A filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 2,700 total annual labor hours and $6.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404S filings, under the Proposed Rules the Commission estimated that 404S filing requirements would affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 54,000 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404S filing requirements will affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,200 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.

Regulations 151.5(g) and 151.5(h) provide procedural documentation requirements for those availing themselves of a bona fide hedging transaction exemption. These firms would be required to document a representation and confirmation by at least one party that the swap counterparty is relying on a bona fide hedge exemption, along with a confirmation of receipt by the other party to the swap. Paragraph (h) of Sec.  151.5 also requires that the written representation and confirmation be retained by the parties and available to the Commission upon request.\\519\n",

Section151.6(c) requires additional information, through a 402S filing, on a trader's uncleared swaps in substantially the same commodity. The Commission has determined to increase the visibility levels from the proposed levels, meaning fewer market participants will be affected by the relevant reporting requirements. In addition, the Proposed Rules included a requirement to submit 404A filings under proposed Sec.  151.6, but the Commission has eliminated this requirement in order to reduce the compliance burden for firms reporting under Sec.  151.6.

In its submission, LCH discussed the classification of interest rate swaps and recommended establishing clearing requirements for classes of interest rate swaps. In effect, LCH recommended the use of a set of basic product specifications to identify and describe each class of swaps subject to the clearing requirement. CME recommended a clearing determination for all non-option interest rate swaps denominated in a currency cleared by any qualified DCO.    As an alternative, the Commission considered whether to establish clearing requirements on a product-by-product basis. The Commission noted in the NPRM that such a determination would need to identify the multitude of specifications of each product that would be subject to the clearing requirement. In this regard, LCH stated in its IRS submission that the clearing requirement ``would be sub-optimal for the overall market if participants are forced to read pages of rules to decipher whether or not a swap is required to be cleared, or to have to make complex and time consuming decisions at the point of execution.'' \\106\n",

Thus, under the final regulations, 404A filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 2,700 total annual labor hours and $6.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404S filings, under the Proposed Rules the Commission estimated that 404S filing requirements would affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 54,000 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404S filing requirements will affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,200 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Section 151.5(e) specifies recordkeeping requirements for traders who claim bona fide hedge exemptions. These recordkeeping requirements include complete books and records concerning all of their related cash, futures, and swap positions and transactions and make such books and records, along with a list of swap counterparties to the Commission. Regulations 151.5(g) and 151.5(h) provide procedural documentation requirements for those availing themselves of a bona fide hedging transaction exemption. These firms would be required to document a representation and confirmation by at least one party that the swap counterparty is relying on a bona fide hedge exemption, along with a confirmation of receipt by the other party to the swap. Paragraph (h) of Sec.  151.5 also requires that the written representation and confirmation be retained by the parties and available to the Commission upon request.\\519\n",

Section 151.6(b) requires the submission of a 401 filing which would provide basic position information on the position exceeding the visibility level. Section151.6(c) requires additional information, through a 402S filing, on a trader's uncleared swaps in substantially the same commodity. The Commission has determined to increase the visibility levels from the proposed levels, meaning fewer market participants will be affected by the relevant reporting requirements. In addition, the Proposed Rules included a requirement to submit 404A filings under proposed Sec.  151.6, but the Commission has eliminated this requirement in order to reduce the compliance burden for firms reporting under Sec.  151.6.

In the final regulations, these requirements will affect approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 8,400 total annual labor hours and $5.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.

If a bona fide hedger seeks an exemption for anticipated commercial production or anticipatory commercial requirements, then the hedger would submit a 404A filing pursuant to Sec.  151.5(c).    Under the Proposed Rules, 404 and 404S filings would have been required on a daily basis. In light of comments concerning the burden of daily filings to both market participants and the Commission, the final regulations require only monthly reporting of 404 and 404S filings. These monthly reports would provide information on daily positions for the month reporting period.    The Commission estimated in the Proposed Rules that these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements would affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $37.6 million across all of these entities, 168,000 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $13.2 million in annual labor costs and $25.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. As a result of modifications made to the Proposed Rules, under the final regulations these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements will affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $28.6 million across all of these entities, 29,700 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $2.3 million in annual labor costs and $26.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404 filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404 filing requirements would affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404 filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404A filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404A filing requirements would affect approximately sixty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 6,000 total annual labor hours and $4.2 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In addition to adjustments in these estimates stemming from the change in the frequency of filings, the estimate of entities affected by 404A filing requirements has been modified to reflect the fact that the final regulations include certain anticipatory hedging exemptions that were absent from the Proposed Rules. Thus, under the final regulations, 404A filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 2,700 total annual labor hours and $6.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.

      " ~~# Error Chunk +2, index: 107||     For purposes of the clearing requirement determination, the Commission developed the following class definitions based on information provided by the submitting DCOs and market conventions.    1. ``Fixed-to-floating swap'': A swap in which the payment or payments owed for one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the payment or payments owed for the other leg are calculated using a floating rate.    2. ``Floating-to-floating swap'' or ``basis swap'': A swap in which the payments for both legs are calculated using floating rates.    3. ``Forward Rate Agreement'' or ``FRA'': A swap in which payments are exchanged on a pre-determined date for a single specified period and one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate that is set on a pre-determined date.    4. ``Overnight indexed swap'' or ``OIS'': A swap for which one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate based on a daily overnight rate.    As described in the NPRM, the LCH and CME IRS submissions addressed issues of classification for purposes of the interest rate swap clearing requirement. In its submission, LCH discussed the classification of interest rate swaps and recommended establishing clearing requirements for classes of interest rate swaps. In effect, LCH recommended the use of a set of basic product specifications to identify and describe each class of swaps subject to the clearing requirement. CME recommended a clearing determination for all non-option interest rate swaps denominated in a currency cleared by any qualified DCO.    As an alternative, the Commission considered whether to establish clearing requirements on a product-by-product basis. The Commission noted in the NPRM that such a determination would need to identify the multitude of specifications of each product that would be subject to the clearing requirement. In this regard, LCH stated in its IRS submission that the clearing requirement ``would be sub-optimal for the overall market if participants are forced to read pages of rules to decipher whether or not a swap is required to be cleared, or to have to make complex and time consuming decisions at the point of execution.'' \\106\n",

      " ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 175||     With respect to the reduction of the timeframe in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) for an FCM to incur a capital charge for undermargined customer accounts, the Commission has considered the comments and has determined to adopt the amendments as proposed. The timely collection of margin is a critical component of an FCM's risk management program and is intended to ensure that an FCM holds sufficient funds deposited by customers to meet their potential obligations to a DCO. As guarantor of the financial performance of the customer accounts that it carries, the FCM is financially responsible if the owner of an account cannot meet its margin obligations to the FCM and ultimately to a DCO.    The timeframe for meeting margin calls currently provided in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) was established in the 1970s when the use of checks and the mail system were more prevalent for depositing margin with an FCM. However, in today's markets, with the increasing use of technology, 24-hour-a-day trading, and the use of wire transfers to meet margin obligations, the Commission believes that the timeframe for taking a capital charge should be reduced both to give an incentive to FCMs to exercise prudent risk management and to strengthen the financial protections of FCMs, and to enhance the safety of the clearing systems and other customers by requiring FCMs to reserve capital for undermargined customer accounts that fail to meet a margin call on a timely basis.    Several commenters have stated that the proposal would harm customers by increasing costs to customers or by exposing more of the customers' funds to the FCM.\\176\n",

      " ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 176|| proposed. As noted above, Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(ix) applies to noncustomers and omnibus accounts carried by an FCM. Many of the concerns raised by the comments regarding the ability to fund a margin call under Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) do not apply to accounts held by an affiliate or an omnibus accounts. Such accounts should pay margin calls promptly and by wire transfer to reduce the potential exposure to the FCM resulting from undermargined accounts.    The Commission also believes that the amendments to Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) and (ix) are appropriate even if the Commission amends its regulations to require an FCM to maintain residual interest in segregated accounts in excess of the undermargined amount of customer accounts. The purpose of the capital rule is to ensure that an FCM maintains sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations as a going concern. Proprietary funds held in segregated accounts that exceed the total obligation to customers are included in an FCM's capital computation. However, in situations where the FCM's residual interest in segregated accounts is covering an undermargined customer account, a capital charge is appropriate because the FCM's residual interest is necessary to cover potential market losses on the undermargined accounts.3. Permit an FCM That Is Not a BD To Develop Policies and Procedures To Determine Creditworthiness    The Commissions proposed to amend Sec.  1.17(c)(v) to permit an FCM that is not a BD to develop a framework to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures for determining creditworthiness of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable. In recommending the proposal, the Commission noted that the SEC proposed to permit a BD to establish written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable.\\177\n",

      " ### ERROR CHUNK ###, index: 177||     Under both the Commission's proposal and the SEC's proposal, an FCM or BD would assess the security's credit risk using the following factors, to the extent appropriate:    <bullet> Credit spreads (i.e., whether it is possible to demonstrate that a position in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock is subject to a minimal amount of credit risk based on the spread between the security's yield and the yield of Treasury or other securities, or based on credit default swap spreads that reference the security);    <bullet> Securities-related research (i.e., whether providers of securities-related research believe the issuer of the security will be able to meet its financial commitments, generally, or specifically, with respect to securities held by the FCM or BD);    <bullet> Internal or external credit risk assessments (i.e., whether credit assessments developed internally by the FCM or BD or externally by a credit rating agency, irrespective of its status as an NRSRO, express a view as to the credit risk associated with a particular security);    <bullet> Default statistics (i.e., whether providers of credit information relating to securities express a view that specific securities have a probability of default consistent with other securities with a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Inclusion on an index (i.e., whether a security, or issuer of the security, is included as a component of a recognized index of instruments that are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Priorities and enhancements (i.e., the extent to which a security is covered by credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization and reserve accounts, or has priority under applicable bankruptcy or creditors' rights provisions);    <bullet> Price, yield and/or volume (i.e., whether the price and yield of a security or a credit default swap that references the security are consistent with other securities that the FCM or BD has determined are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk and whether the price resulted from active trading); and    <bullet> Asset class-specific factors (e.g., in the case of structured finance products, the quality of the underlying assets).

      " ~~# Error Chunk +2, index: 107||     For purposes of the clearing requirement determination, the Commission developed the following class definitions based on information provided by the submitting DCOs and market conventions.    1. ``Fixed-to-floating swap'': A swap in which the payment or payments owed for one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the payment or payments owed for the other leg are calculated using a floating rate.    2. ``Floating-to-floating swap'' or ``basis swap'': A swap in which the payments for both legs are calculated using floating rates.    3. ``Forward Rate Agreement'' or ``FRA'': A swap in which payments are exchanged on a pre-determined date for a single specified period and one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate that is set on a pre-determined date.    4. ``Overnight indexed swap'' or ``OIS'': A swap for which one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate based on a daily overnight rate.    As described in the NPRM, the LCH and CME IRS submissions addressed issues of classification for purposes of the interest rate swap clearing requirement. In its submission, LCH discussed the classification of interest rate swaps and recommended establishing clearing requirements for classes of interest rate swaps. In effect, LCH recommended the use of a set of basic product specifications to identify and describe each class of swaps subject to the clearing requirement. CME recommended a clearing determination for all non-option interest rate swaps denominated in a currency cleared by any qualified DCO.    As an alternative, the Commission considered whether to establish clearing requirements on a product-by-product basis. The Commission noted in the NPRM that such a determination would need to identify the multitude of specifications of each product that would be subject to the clearing requirement. In this regard, LCH stated in its IRS submission that the clearing requirement ``would be sub-optimal for the overall market if participants are forced to read pages of rules to decipher whether or not a swap is required to be cleared, or to have to make complex and time consuming decisions at the point of execution.'' \\106\n",

As described in the NPRM, the LCH and CME IRS submissions addressed issues of classification for purposes of the interest rate swap clearing requirement. In its submission, LCH discussed the classification of interest rate swaps and recommended establishing clearing requirements for classes of interest rate swaps. In effect, LCH recommended the use of a set of basic product specifications to identify and describe each class of swaps subject to the clearing requirement. CME recommended a clearing determination for all non-option interest rate swaps denominated in a currency cleared by any qualified DCO.    As an alternative, the Commission considered whether to establish clearing requirements on a product-by-product basis. The Commission noted in the NPRM that such a determination would need to identify the multitude of specifications of each product that would be subject to the clearing requirement. In this regard, LCH stated in its IRS submission that the clearing requirement ``would be sub-optimal for the overall market if participants are forced to read pages of rules to decipher whether or not a swap is required to be cleared, or to have to make complex and time consuming decisions at the point of execution.'' \\106\n",

      " ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 518|| hedging needs increase. If a bona fide hedger seeks an exemption for anticipated commercial production or anticipatory commercial requirements, then the hedger would submit a 404A filing pursuant to Sec.  151.5(c).    Under the Proposed Rules, 404 and 404S filings would have been required on a daily basis. In light of comments concerning the burden of daily filings to both market participants and the Commission, the final regulations require only monthly reporting of 404 and 404S filings. These monthly reports would provide information on daily positions for the month reporting period.    The Commission estimated in the Proposed Rules that these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements would affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $37.6 million across all of these entities, 168,000 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $13.2 million in annual labor costs and $25.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. As a result of modifications made to the Proposed Rules, under the final regulations these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements will affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $28.6 million across all of these entities, 29,700 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $2.3 million in annual labor costs and $26.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404 filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404 filing requirements would affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404 filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404A filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404A filing requirements would affect approximately sixty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 6,000 total annual labor hours and $4.2 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In addition to adjustments in these estimates stemming from the change in the frequency of filings, the estimate of entities affected by 404A filing requirements has been modified to reflect the fact that the final regulations include certain anticipatory hedging exemptions that were absent from the Proposed Rules. Thus, under the final regulations, 404A filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 2,700 total annual labor hours and $6.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404S filings, under the Proposed Rules the Commission estimated that 404S filing requirements would affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 54,000 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404S filing requirements will affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,200 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Section 151.5(e) specifies recordkeeping requirements for traders who claim bona fide hedge exemptions. These recordkeeping requirements include complete books and records concerning all of their related cash, futures, and swap positions and transactions and make such books and records, along with a list of swap counterparties to the Commission. Regulations 151.5(g) and 151.5(h) provide procedural documentation requirements for those availing themselves of a bona fide hedging transaction exemption. These firms would be required to document a representation and confirmation by at least one party that the swap counterparty is relying on a bona fide hedge exemption, along with a confirmation of receipt by the other party to the swap. Paragraph (h) of Sec.  151.5 also requires that the written representation and confirmation be retained by the parties and available to the Commission upon request.\\519\n",

      " ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 519||     Section 151.6 requires traders with positions exceeding visibility levels in Referenced Contracts in metal and energy commodities to submit additional information about cash market and derivatives activity in substantially the same commodity. Section 151.6(b) requires the submission of a 401 filing which would provide basic position information on the position exceeding the visibility level. Section151.6(c) requires additional information, through a 402S filing, on a trader's uncleared swaps in substantially the same commodity. The Commission has determined to increase the visibility levels from the proposed levels, meaning fewer market participants will be affected by the relevant reporting requirements. In addition, the Proposed Rules included a requirement to submit 404A filings under proposed Sec.  151.6, but the Commission has eliminated this requirement in order to reduce the compliance burden for firms reporting under Sec.  151.6.    Requirements under 401 filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately one hundred forty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,800 total annual labor hours and $15.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, these requirements will affect approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 8,400 total annual labor hours and $5.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Requirements under 402S filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 5,600 total annual labor hours and $4.9 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, the Commission has eliminated the 402S filing, thus eliminating any burden stemming from such reports.

      " ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 175||     With respect to the reduction of the timeframe in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) for an FCM to incur a capital charge for undermargined customer accounts, the Commission has considered the comments and has determined to adopt the amendments as proposed. The timely collection of margin is a critical component of an FCM's risk management program and is intended to ensure that an FCM holds sufficient funds deposited by customers to meet their potential obligations to a DCO. As guarantor of the financial performance of the customer accounts that it carries, the FCM is financially responsible if the owner of an account cannot meet its margin obligations to the FCM and ultimately to a DCO.    The timeframe for meeting margin calls currently provided in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) was established in the 1970s when the use of checks and the mail system were more prevalent for depositing margin with an FCM. However, in today's markets, with the increasing use of technology, 24-hour-a-day trading, and the use of wire transfers to meet margin obligations, the Commission believes that the timeframe for taking a capital charge should be reduced both to give an incentive to FCMs to exercise prudent risk management and to strengthen the financial protections of FCMs, and to enhance the safety of the clearing systems and other customers by requiring FCMs to reserve capital for undermargined customer accounts that fail to meet a margin call on a timely basis.    Several commenters have stated that the proposal would harm customers by increasing costs to customers or by exposing more of the customers' funds to the FCM.\\176\n",
      " ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
      " ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 176|| proposed. As noted above, Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(ix) applies to noncustomers and omnibus accounts carried by an FCM. Many of the concerns raised by the comments regarding the ability to fund a margin call under Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) do not apply to accounts held by an affiliate or an omnibus accounts. Such accounts should pay margin calls promptly and by wire transfer to reduce the potential exposure to the FCM resulting from undermargined accounts.    The Commission also believes that the amendments to Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) and (ix) are appropriate even if the Commission amends its regulations to require an FCM to maintain residual interest in segregated accounts in excess of the undermargined amount of customer accounts. The purpose of the capital rule is to ensure that an FCM maintains sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations as a going concern. Proprietary funds held in segregated accounts that exceed the total obligation to customers are included in an FCM's capital computation. However, in situations where the FCM's residual interest in segregated accounts is covering an undermargined customer account, a capital charge is appropriate because the FCM's residual interest is necessary to cover potential market losses on the undermargined accounts.3. Permit an FCM That Is Not a BD To Develop Policies and Procedures To Determine Creditworthiness    The Commissions proposed to amend Sec.  1.17(c)(v) to permit an FCM that is not a BD to develop a framework to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures for determining creditworthiness of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable. In recommending the proposal, the Commission noted that the SEC proposed to permit a BD to establish written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable.\\177\n",

      " ### ERROR CHUNK ###, index: 177||     Under both the Commission's proposal and the SEC's proposal, an FCM or BD would assess the security's credit risk using the following factors, to the extent appropriate:    <bullet> Credit spreads (i.e., whether it is possible to demonstrate that a position in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock is subject to a minimal amount of credit risk based on the spread between the security's yield and the yield of Treasury or other securities, or based on credit default swap spreads that reference the security);    <bullet> Securities-related research (i.e., whether providers of securities-related research believe the issuer of the security will be able to meet its financial commitments, generally, or specifically, with respect to securities held by the FCM or BD);    <bullet> Internal or external credit risk assessments (i.e., whether credit assessments developed internally by the FCM or BD or externally by a credit rating agency, irrespective of its status as an NRSRO, express a view as to the credit risk associated with a particular security);    <bullet> Default statistics (i.e., whether providers of credit information relating to securities express a view that specific securities have a probability of default consistent with other securities with a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Inclusion on an index (i.e., whether a security, or issuer of the security, is included as a component of a recognized index of instruments that are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Priorities and enhancements (i.e., the extent to which a security is covered by credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization and reserve accounts, or has priority under applicable bankruptcy or creditors' rights provisions);    <bullet> Price, yield and/or volume (i.e., whether the price and yield of a security or a credit default swap that references the security are consistent with other securities that the FCM or BD has determined are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk and whether the price resulted from active trading); and    <bullet> Asset class-specific factors (e.g., in the case of structured finance products, the quality of the underlying assets).
