Section 21 of the CEA was added by section 728 of the Dodd-\\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank \\nAct\\'\\').\\n\\nDATES: Effective date is October 31, 2011. Applicants at that time may \\napply for registration as SDRs but are not required to do so. Mandatory \\nregistration and compliance with the registration rules will occur upon \\nthe effective date of the swap definition rulemaking, which the \\nCommission will publish at a later date.\\n\\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For questions relating to this \\nrulemaking: Jeffrey P.

Overview\\n\\n    On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank \\nAct.\\\\1\\\\ Title VII \\\\2\\\\ amended the CEA \\\\3\\\\ to establish a comprehensive \\nnew regulatory framework for swaps and security-based swaps. The \\nlegislation was enacted to reduce risk, increase transparency and \\npromote market integrity within the financial system by, among other \\nthings (1) providing for the registration and comprehensive regulation \\nof swap dealers (``SDs\\'\\') and major swap participants (``MSPs\\'\\'); (2) \\nimposing clearing and trade execution requirements on standardized \\nderivative products; (3) creating robust recordkeeping and real-time \\nreporting regimes; and (4) enhancing the Commission\\'s rulemaking and \\nenforcement authorities with respect to, among others, all registered \\nentities and intermediaries subject to the Commission\\'s oversight.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\1\\\\ See Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \\nAct, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), available at <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/OTCDERIVATIVES/index.htm\">http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/OTCDERIVATIVES/index.htm</a>.\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Pursuant to section 701 of the Dodd-Frank Act, Title VII may \\nbe cited as the ``Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of \\n2010.\\'\\'\\n    \\\\3\\\\ 7 U.S.C. 1, et seq.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To enhance transparency, promote standardization and reduce \\nsystemic risk, section 727 of the Dodd-Frank Act added to the CEA new \\nsection 2(a)(13)(G), which requires all swaps--whether cleared or \\nuncleared--to be reported to SDRs,\\\\4\\\\ which are new registered entities \\ncreated by section 728 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\\\\5\\\\ SDRs are required to \\nperform specified functions related to the collection and\\n\\n[[Page 54539]]\\n\\nmaintenance \\\\6\\\\ of swap transaction data and information and to make \\nsuch data and information directly and electronically available to \\nregulators. Section 728 of the Dodd-Frank Act added to the CEA new \\nsection 21 governing registration and regulation of SDRs and directed \\nthe Commission to promulgate rules governing those duties and \\nresponsibilities. Section 21 requires that SDRs register with the \\nCommission regardless of whether they are also licensed as a bank or \\nregistered as a security-based swap data repository with the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission (``SEC\\'\\'), and to submit to inspection and \\nexamination by the Commission.\\\\7\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\4\\\\ Section 721 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends section 1a of the \\nCEA to add the definition of SDR. Pursuant to section 1a(48), the \\nterm ``swap data repository means any person that collects and \\nmaintains information or records with respect to transactions or \\npositions in, or the terms and conditions of, swaps entered into by \\nthird parties for the purpose of providing a centralized \\nrecordkeeping facility for swaps.\\'\\' 7 U.S.C. 1a(48).\\n    \\\\5\\\\ The Commission notes that currently there are global trade \\nrepositories for credit, interest rate and equity swaps. Since 2009, \\nall G-14 dealers have submitted credit swap data to the Depository \\nTrust and Clearing Corporation\\'s (``DTCC\\'\\') Trade Information \\nWarehouse. In January 2010 TriOptima launched the Global OTC \\nDerivatives Interest Rate Trade Reporting Repository after selection \\nby the Rates Steering Committee of the International Swaps and \\nDerivatives Association (``ISDA\\'\\') to provide a trade repository to \\ncollect information on trades in interest rate swaps. In August \\n2010, DTCC also launched the Equity Derivatives Reporting Repository \\nfor equity swaps and other equity derivatives. Other entities may \\nalso perform trade repository functions on a more limited basis \\nbased on various business models and/or regional or localized \\nconsiderations. In addition, a variety of firms also provide \\nancillary services and functions essential to the efficient \\noperation of trade reporting of swaps. Recently, ISDA in \\nanticipation of the implementation of swap data reporting and SDR \\nrequirements related to the Dodd-Frank Act selected DTCC and a joint \\nventure between DTCC\\'s Deriv/SERV and EFETnet as ``global\\'\\' \\nrepositories for interest rates available at <a href=\"http://www2.isda.org/attachment/MzExMQ==/InterestRatesRepositorySelection.pdf\">http://www2.isda.org/attachment/MzExMQ==/InterestRatesRepositorySelection.pdf</a> and \\ncommodities available at <a href=\"http://www2.isda.org/attachment/MzIwNw==/CommodityRepositorySelection.pdf\">http://www2.isda.org/attachment/MzIwNw==/CommodityRepositorySelection.pdf</a>. In addition, the Global FX \\nDivisions of the Association of Financial Markets Europe (AFME), \\nSecurities industry and Financial Markets (SIFMA) and the Asian \\nSecurities industry and Financial Markets (ASIFMA) have recommended \\na partnership with DTCC and SWIFT for the purpose of developing a \\nforeign exchange trade repository available at <a href=\"http://www.sifma.org/news/news.aspx?id=8589934651\">http://www.sifma.org/news/news.aspx?id=8589934651</a>.\\n    \\\\6\\\\ See Commission, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Swap Data \\nRecordkeeping and Reporting Requirements, 75 FR 76574 (Dec. 8, 2010) \\n(``Data NPRM\\'\\'). The Data NPRM, among other things, proposed \\nregulations governing SDR data collection and reporting \\nresponsibilities under part 45 of the Commission\\'s regulations.\\n    \\\\7\\\\ Section 21(a)(1)(B) permits derivatives clearing \\norganizations (``DCOs\\'\\') to register as SDRs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To register and maintain registration with the Commission, SDRs are \\nrequired to comply with specific duties and core principles enumerated \\nin section 21 as well as other requirements that the Commission may \\nprescribe by rule. As described more fully in the Commission\\'s Notice \\nof Proposed Rulemaking (``SDR NPRM\\'\\'),\\\\8\\\\ new section 21(c) mandates \\nthat SDRs (1) accept data; (2) confirm with both counterparties the \\naccuracy of submitted data; (3) maintain data according to standards \\nprescribed by the Commission; (4) provide direct electronic access to \\nthe Commission or any designee of the Commission (including another \\nregistered entity); (5) provide public reporting of swap data in the \\nform and frequency required by the Commission; (6) establish automated \\nsystems for monitoring and analyzing data (including the use of end \\nuser clearing exemptions) at the direction of the Commission; (7) \\nmaintain user privacy; (8) on a confidential basis, pursuant to section \\n8 of the CEA,\\\\9\\\\ upon request and after notifying the Commission, make \\ndata available to other specified regulators; and (9) establish and \\nmaintain emergency and business continuity-disaster recovery procedures \\n(``BC-DR\\'\\'). In connection with the sharing of confidential information \\nwith other regulators, the SDR must, pursuant to new section 21(d), \\nreceive a written agreement from such regulator, prior to sharing the \\ninformation, stating that it will abide by the confidentiality \\nprovisions of section 8 and agree to indemnify both the SDR and the \\nCommission against any litigation expenses relating to information \\nprovided under section 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\8\\\\ Commission, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Swap Data \\nRepositories, 75 FR 80898 (Dec. 23, 2010).\\n    \\\\9\\\\ Section 8(e) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 12(e), establishes among \\nother things the conditions under which the Commission may furnish \\ninformation obtained in connection with the administration of the \\nCEA to any department or agency of the United States. Such \\ninformation shall not be disclosed by such department or agency \\nexcept in any action or proceeding under the laws of the United \\nStates to which it, the Commission or the United States is a party.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    New section 21(e) also added a provision that each SDR designate a \\nchief compliance officer (``CCO\\'\\') with specified duties. New section \\n21(f) established three focused core principles. First, unless \\nnecessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the CEA, an SDR may \\nnot adopt any rule or take any action that results in any unreasonable \\nrestraint or trade, or impose any material anticompetitive burden on \\nthe trading, clearing or reporting of transactions. Second, each SDR \\nmust establish transparent governance arrangements to fulfill the \\npublic interest requirements of the CEA and support the objectives of \\nthe Federal government, owners and participants. Third, each SDR must \\nestablish and enforce rules to minimize conflicts of interest in the \\nSDR\\'s decision-making processes and establish a process for resolving \\nconflicts of interest. Section 21(f) further directs the Commission to \\nestablish additional duties for SDRs to minimize conflicts of interest, \\nprotect data, ensure compliance and guarantee the safety and security \\nof the SDR.\\\\10\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\10\\\\ Pursuant to this provision, the Commission also may develop \\nadditional duties taking into account evolving standards of the \\nUnited States and the international community. Section 21(f)(4) of \\nthe CEA, 7 U.S.C. 24a(f)(4). This provision is sometimes referred to \\nas ``Core Principle 4.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nB. International Considerations\\n\\n    Section 752(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Commission to \\nconsult and coordinate with foreign regulatory authorities regarding \\nthe establishment of consistent international standards for the \\nregulation of swaps and various ``swap entities.\\'\\' The Commission is \\ncommitted to a cooperative international approach to the registration \\nand regulation of SDRs and has consulted extensively with various \\nforeign regulatory authorities in promulgating both its proposed and \\nfinal regulations. In this regard, both the proposed and final part 49 \\nregulations reflect the Commission\\'s intent to harmonize our approach \\nto the extent possible with the European Commission\\'s regulatory \\nproposal related to OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade \\nrepositories.\\\\11\\\\ The Commission\\'s part 49 regulations also largely \\nadopt the recommendations of the May 2010 ``CPSS-IOSCO Consultative \\nReport, Considerations for Trade Repositories in the OTC Derivatives \\nMarket\\'\\' (``Working Group Report\\'\\').\\\\12\\\\ The Commission believes that \\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and the part 49 regulations are consistent with the \\ngoals of the Working Group Report. As noted in the SDR NPRM, section 21 \\nof the CEA does not authorize the Commission to exempt any entity \\nperforming the functions of an SDR from the registration requirements \\nor any other duties established by the Dodd-Frank Act.\\\\13\\\\ Certain non-\\nU.S. swap activity is excluded, however, from the reach of the Dodd-\\nFrank Act and Commission regulations pursuant to section 2(i) of the \\nCEA.\\\\14\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\11\\\\ See Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament \\nand of the Council on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties, and \\nTrade Repositories (the ``European Commission Proposal\\'\\'), COM \\n(2010). See also SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80899-80900 and note 16. \\nThe proposal, if implemented, would become a part of the European \\nUnion\\'s framework for financial supervision. The European Union is \\ncomposed of 27 member states and the European Securities and Markets \\nAuthority will supervise the European securities markets along with \\nthe national regulators of the member states.\\n    \\\\12\\\\ This working group was jointly established by the Committee \\non Payment and Settlement Systems (``CPSS\\'\\') of the Bank of \\nInternational Settlements (``BIS\\'\\') and the Technical Committee of \\nthe International Organization of Securities Commissions \\n(``IOSCO\\'\\'). The Working Group Report presented a set of factors to \\nconsider in connection with the design, operation and regulation of \\nSDRs. A significant focus of the Working Group Report is access to \\nSDR data by appropriate regulators: the report urges that a trade \\nrepository ``should support market transparency by making data \\navailable to relevant authorities and the public in line with their \\nrespective information needs.\\'\\' The Working Group Report is \\navailable at <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss90.pdf\">http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss90.pdf</a>.

Summary of the Proposed Part 49 Regulations\\n\\n    Against this background, the Commission developed and published for \\ncomment part 49 of the\\n\\n[[Page 54540]]\\n\\nCommission\\'s regulations establishing provisions applicable to the \\nregistration and regulation of SDRs.\\\\15\\\\ Proposed part 49 of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations included procedures and substantive \\nrequirements to achieve and maintain registration as an SDR--including \\nproposed standards for compliance with each of the statutory duties \\nenumerated in section 21(c), the three core principles outlined in \\nsection 21(f), and proposed additional duties consistent with the \\nauthority conferred by section 21(f)(4).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\15\\\\ A full description and discussion of each proposed rule can \\nbe found in the SDR NPRM, supra note 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Proposed Regulations Related to Registration\\n    Section 21(a)(1)(A) makes it unlawful for any person, unless \\nregistered with the Commission, directly or indirectly to make use of \\nthe mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to \\nperform the functions of an SDR. Consistent with this statutory \\ndirective, the Commission proposed regulations establishing procedural \\nand substantive requirements governing registration as an SDR.\\\\16\\\\ The \\nproposed regulations required that SDRs specify the asset class or \\nclasses for which they will accept swap data and undertake to accept \\nall swaps in asset classes for which they have specified.\\\\17\\\\ If the \\napplicant is a foreign entity, the proposed regulations specified that \\nit be required to certify, and provide an opinion of counsel, that as a \\nmatter of law it is able to provide the Commission with prompt access \\nto its books and records and to submit to onsite inspection and \\nexamination by the Commission.\\\\18\\\\ The proposal established the \\nstandard of review as well as the standards for denial, suspension and \\nrevocation of registration. In addition, the proposed rules provided a \\n``provisional registration\\'\\' for SDR applicants that are in substantial \\ncompliance with the registration standards set forth in the \\nregulations.\\\\19\\\\ With respect to Commission review of SDR rules and \\nrule amendments, the proposed rules provided procedures by which an \\napplicant for SDR registration may either request that the Commission \\napprove any or all of its rules or self-certify that its rules comply \\nwith the CEA or Commission regulations thereunder (``self \\ncertification\\'\\').\\\\20\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\16\\\\ Proposed Sec. Sec.  49.3-49.4 and 49.6-49.7; Proposed Form \\nSDR.\\n    \\\\17\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.10. Proposed Sec.  49.2(a)(2) defines the \\nterm ``asset class\\'\\' as those swaps in a particular broad category \\nof goods, services or commodities underlying a swap. The asset \\nclasses include credit, equity, interest rates, currency, other \\ncommodities, and such other asset classes as may be determined by \\nthe Commission.\\n    \\\\18\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.7.\\n    \\\\19\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.3(b).\\n    \\\\20\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The proposed regulations separately required SDRs to file with the \\nCommission a notice of an equity interest transfer of ten percent or \\nmore, as defined in the Commission\\'s revised part 40 rules \\\\21\\\\ and \\nspecified the necessary information and related notifications. \\nSimilarly, the proposed rules described the procedures and requirements \\nfor registering successor entities of an SDR.\\\\22\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\21\\\\ See Commission, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Revisions to \\npart 40 (Provisions Common to Registered Entities), 75 FR 67282 \\n(Nov. 2, 2010)(``Part 40 NPRM\\'\\') and Final rule: Revisions to part \\n40 (Provisions Common to Registered Entities), 76 FR 44776 (July 27, \\n2011)(``Part 40 Adopting Release\\'\\') (collectively, ``part 40\\'\\').\\n    \\\\22\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Proposed Regulations Related to Statutory Duties of SDRs\\n    Section 21(c) of the CEA prescribes the minimum duties required of \\nSDRs. To register and maintain registration, an SDR must (i) accept \\nswap data as prescribed by the Commission; (ii) confirm with both \\ncounterparties to a swap the accuracy of the data; (iii) maintain the \\ndata submitted; (iv) provide the Commission or its designee (including \\nanother registered entity) with direct electronic access to the swap \\ndata; (v) provide the information prescribed by the Commission to \\ncomply with the public reporting requirements set forth in section \\n2(a)(13) of the CEA; (vi) establish automated systems for monitoring, \\nscreening, and analyzing swap data; (vii) maintain the privacy and \\nconfidentiality of any and all swap data received by the SDR; (viii) \\nprovide access to the swap data to specified appropriate domestic and \\nforeign regulators; and (ix) adopt and implement emergency and BC-DR \\nprocedures.\\n    Pursuant to the authority granted by sections 21(f)(4) \\\\23\\\\ and \\n8a(5) \\\\24\\\\ of the CEA, the Commission proposed to include in part 49 \\nfour additional duties requiring SDRs to (i) adopt and implement system \\nsafeguards, including BC-DR plans; (ii) maintain sufficient financial \\nresources; (iii) furnish market participants with a disclosure document \\nsetting forth the risks and costs associated with using the services of \\nan SDR; and (iv) provide fair and open access and fees and charges that \\nare equitable and non-discriminatory. Proposed Sec. Sec.  49.9-49.18 \\nand 49.23-49.27 described the standards for compliance with each of \\nthese duties.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\23\\\\ Section 21(f)(4) of the CEA; see supra note 10.\\n    \\\\24\\\\ Section 8a(5) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 12a(5), authorizes the \\nCommission to promulgate such rules and regulations as, in the \\njudgment of the Commission, are reasonably necessary to effectuate \\nany of the provisions or accomplish any of the purposes of the CEA. \\nIn connection with SDRs, section 21(a)(3)(A)(ii), 7 U.S.C. \\n24a(3)(A)(ii), specifically requires that an SDR, to be registered \\nand maintain registration, must comply with any requirement that the \\nCommission may impose by rule or regulation pursuant to section \\n8a(5) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Proposed Regulations Related to Data Acceptance, Accuracy and \\nRecordkeeping\\n    Sections 21(c)(1)-(5) of the CEA, as adopted by section 728 of the \\nDodd-Frank Act, address the duties of SDRs in connection with accepting \\nand maintaining swap data, ensuring accuracy and reliability, and \\nproviding direct electronic data access to the Commission or its \\ndesignee.\\\\25\\\\ To implement section 21(c)(1), the Commission proposed \\nthat SDRs adopt policies and procedures that will enable them to \\nelectronically accept data and other regulatory information, and to \\naccept all swaps in an asset class, or classes, for which they have \\nregistered.\\\\26\\\\ The Commission also proposed that SDRs establish \\npolicies and procedures to prevent a valid swap from being invalidated, \\naltered or modified through the SDR\\'s confirmation or recording \\nprocess, and provide facilities for effectively resolving disputes \\nconcerning the accuracy of swap data and positions recorded by the \\nSDR.\\\\27\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\25\\\\ In a companion rulemaking under new part 45 of its \\nregulations, the Commission has proposed data elements that must be \\nreported to SDRs and has in addition provided specific requirements \\nfor SDRs relating to (i) determining which counterparty must report \\nthe swap data to the SDR; (ii) third-party facilitation of swap data \\nreporting; (iii) reporting to a single SDR in connection with the \\nreporting of swap data; and (iv) reporting errors and omissions. See \\nData NPRM supra note 6.\\n    \\\\26\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.10.\\n    \\\\27\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.11 implemented section 21(c)(2) of the CEA and \\nspecified that an SDR adopt policies and procedures to ensure the \\naccuracy of swap data reported to it, and must confirm with both \\ncounterparties to the swap \\\\28\\\\ the accuracy of data and information \\nsubmitted by them.\\\\29\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\28\\\\ These proposed confirmation requirements would not apply to \\nreal-time public reporting. See proposed Sec.  43.3(f) set forth in \\nCommission, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Real-Time Public \\nReporting of Swap Transaction Data, 74 FR 76140 (Dec. 7, 2010) (the \\n``Real-Time NPRM\\'\\').\\n    \\\\29\\\\ As noted, the form and content of the swap data ultimately \\nwill be established in the Commission\\'s part 45 regulations related \\nto data elements and standards. The Data NPRM detailed and defined \\nthe terms ``confirmation\\'\\' and ``confirmation data.\\'\\' See Data NPRM \\nsupra note 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.12 implemented section 21(c)(3) of the CEA and \\nrequired\\n\\n[[Page 54541]]\\n\\nSDRs to maintain the books and records of all activity and data \\nrelating to swaps reported to the SDR, consistent with recordkeeping \\nand reporting rules to be established in new parts 43 and 45 of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations.\\\\30\\\\ As proposed, Sec.  49.12 required that \\nSDR books and records be open to inspection on request by any \\nrepresentative of the Commission, the United States Department of \\nJustice, the SEC or any representative of a prudential regulator \\nauthorized by the Commission. The proposal would further require each \\nSDR that publicly disseminates swap data in real time to comply with \\nthe real-time reporting requirements prescribed in part 43.\\\\31\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\30\\\\ See Sec.  45.2 set forth in the Data NPRM supra note 6 and \\nSec.  43.3 set forth in Real-Time NPRM supra note 28.\\n    \\\\31\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission proposed two requirements in connection with the \\nprovision of direct electronic access mandated by section 21(c)(4) of \\nthe CEA. First, SDRs would be required to provide the Commission or its \\ndesignee with connectivity and access to the SDR\\'s database; second, \\nSDRs would be required to electronically deliver to the Commission or \\nits designee certain data in the form and manner prescribed by the \\nCommission.\\\\32\\\\ The Commission also proposed that SDRs be required to \\nprovide it with monitoring tools identical to those provided to the \\nSDR\\'s compliance staff and CCO.\\\\33\\\\ In connection with section \\n21(c)(5)\\'s mandate that SDRs establish automated systems for \\nmonitoring, screening and analyzing swap data, the Commission proposed \\nthat at this time SDRs establish the infrastructure necessary to \\nfulfill the statutory requirement.\\\\34\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\32\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.17.\\n    \\\\33\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\34\\\\ Proposed Sec. Sec.  49.13 and 49.14. The latter proposal \\nwas designed to implement the Commission\\'s program to monitor and \\nprevent abuse of end-user clearing exemption claims. See section \\n2(h)(7) of the CEA, as amended, which creates a framework by which \\ncertain swaps may be exempt from clearing if one of its \\ncounterparties is (i) not a financial entity; (ii) is using swaps to \\nhedge or mitigate commercial risk; and (iii) notifies the Commission \\nas to how it generally meets the financial obligations associated \\nwith entering into non-cleared swaps (the ``end-user clearing \\nexemption\\'\\'). See Commission, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: End-\\nUser Exemption to Mandatory Clearing of Swaps, 75 FR 80747 (Dec. 23, \\n2010) (``End-User NPRM\\'\\').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n4. Proposed Regulations Relating to Data Privacy, Confidentiality and \\nAccess\\n    Section 21(c)(6) of the CEA requires that an SDR maintain the \\nprivacy of all swap transaction information that it receives from an \\nSD, counterparty or any other registered entity. The Commission \\nrecognized that data related to real-time public reporting is, by its \\nnature, publicly available, while detailed core data intended for use \\nby the Commission and other regulators is subject to statutory \\nconfidential treatment. Accordingly, the Commission proposed to \\nimplement section 21(c)(6)\\'s mandate--and also in part the conflicts of \\ninterest core principle applicable to SDRs (``Core Principle 3\\'\\')--by \\nrequiring that ``SDR Information\\'\\' that is not subject to real-time \\nreporting be treated as non-public and confidential and may not be \\naccessed, disclosed, or used for purposes unrelated to SDR \\nresponsibilities under the CEA unless the submitters of the data \\nexplicitly agree to such use.\\\\35\\\\ The proposed regulation also directed \\nSDRs to establish and maintain safeguards, policies and procedures \\naddressing the misappropriation or misuse of swap data that the \\nCommission is prohibited from disclosing pursuant to section 8 of the \\nCEA (``Section 8 Material\\'\\') \\\\36\\\\ or similar material, such as \\nintellectual property.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\35\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.16. However, aggregated data that cannot \\nbe attributed to individual transactions or market participants may \\nbe made publicly available by SDRs.\\n    \\\\36\\\\ Id. Section 8(a) of the CEA prohibits the Commission from \\ndisclosing information or material if it ``would separately disclose \\nthe business transactions or market positions of any person and \\ntrade secrets or names of customers.\\'\\' See also the definition of \\n``Section 8 Material\\'\\' in Sec.  49.2(a)(14).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission proposed to prohibit the use of SDR data for \\ncommercial or business purposes by the SDR or any of its affiliated \\nentities with a limited exception where the SDR has received the \\nexpress written consent of the market participants who submitted the \\nswap data.\\\\37\\\\ The proposal required that SDRs develop and maintain \\nfirewalls to protect data they are required to maintain, and permitted \\naccess to third-party service providers so long as they have \\nimplemented stringent confidentiality procedures to protect data and \\ninformation from improper disclosure.\\\\38\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\37\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.17(g)(2).\\n    \\\\38\\\\  Id. This proposal was intended to partially implement \\nsection 21(c)(6)\\'s privacy provisions as well as the provisions of \\nsection 21(f)(3), which requires an SDR to establish and enforce \\nrules to mitigate conflicts of interest. See SDR NPRM supra note 8 \\nat 80911.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section 21(c)(7) requires that an SDR make data available to \\ncertain domestic and foreign regulators (``Appropriate Domestic \\nRegulator\\'\\' or ``Appropriate Foreign Regulator\\'\\') under specified \\ncircumstances. To implement this provision, the Commission proposed \\ndefinitions and standards for determining appropriateness--such as an \\nexisting memorandum of understanding (``MOU\\'\\') or similar agreement \\nexecuted with the Commission--as well as procedures for gaining access \\nto data maintained by SDRs.\\\\39\\\\ Separately, section 21(d) mandates that \\nprior to receipt of any requested data or information from an SDR, the \\nAppropriate Foreign or Appropriate Domestic Regulator must execute a \\n``Confidentiality and Indemnification Agreement\\'\\' with the SDR. The \\nCommission proposed to implement this provision by requiring that such \\nan agreement be executed between SDRs and each appropriate \\nregulator.\\\\40\\\\ The Commission acknowledged in the SDR NPRM that this \\nrequirement could have the unintended effect of inhibiting access to \\ndata maintained by SDRs. Consistent with the international \\nharmonization envisioned by section 752 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the \\nCommission stated that it will endeavor to provide sufficient access to \\nSDR data to Appropriate Foreign and Domestic Regulators. In that \\nregard, the Commission noted that pursuant to section 8(e) of the CEA \\nit may share confidential information in its possession with any \\nforeign futures authority, department or agency of any foreign \\ngovernment or political subdivision thereof.\\\\41\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\39\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\40\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.18.\\n    \\\\41\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80910.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n5. Proposed Regulations Related to Emergency Procedures\\n    To implement section 21(c)(8), the Commission proposed Sec.  49.23 \\nto require SDRs to adopt specific policies and procedures for the \\nexercise of emergency authority. The Commission based its proposals on \\nexisting emergency authority concepts--in particular, the application \\nguidance for former designated contract market (``DCM\\'\\') Core Principle \\n6.\\\\42\\\\ As proposed, Sec.  49.23 required SDRs to enumerate the \\ncircumstances in which it is authorized to invoke its emergency \\nauthority, applicable procedures, and the range of measures it is \\nauthorized to take in response to an emergency. Further, the emergency \\npolicies and procedures adopted by an SDR must specifically address \\nconflicts of interest and include a requirement that the SDR\\'s CCO be \\nconsulted in any emergency that may raise conflicts of interest. The \\nproposal further required an SDR to identify to the Commission the \\npersons authorized to exercise emergency authority and the chain of \\ncommand, and to promptly notify the\\n\\n[[Page 54542]]\\n\\nCommission of any emergency action taken.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\42\\\\ Id. at 80911.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n6. Regulations Related to Designation of a Chief Compliance Officer\\n    Section 21(e) establishes the CCO as a focal point for compliance. \\nThe Commission implemented section 21(e) in proposed Sec.  49.22, which \\nfurther developed and detailed CCO statutory requirements and \\nresponsibilities. Specifically, proposed Sec.  49.22 established the \\nsupervisory regime applicable to CCOs; specified removal provisions; \\nspecified the duties and authorities of CCOs; and detailed the \\ninformation that must be included in the required annual compliance \\nreport and the procedure for submission of the report to the \\nCommission.\\n7. Core Principles Applicable to SDRs\\n    Unlike prescriptive rules, core principles generally provide the \\nregistered entity with reasonable discretion in establishing the manner \\nof compliance with each specified principle. Section 21(f) enumerates \\nthree focused core principles applicable to SDRs: (1) Antitrust \\nconsiderations (``Core Principle 1\\'\\'); (2) governance arrangements \\n(``Core Principle 2\\'\\'); and (3) conflicts of interest, Core Principle \\n3.\\\\43\\\\ With respect to Core Principle 1, antitrust considerations, the \\nCommission proposed in Sec.  49.19 that, unless necessary or \\nappropriate to achieve the purposes of the CEA, SDRs should avoid \\nadopting any rule, regulation or policy or taking any action that \\nresults in an unreasonable restraint of trade or imposes any material \\nanticompetitive burden on the trading, clearing, reporting, and/or \\nprocessing of swaps.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\43\\\\ Section 21(f)(4), the ``fourth core principle,\\'\\' grants \\nbroad rulemaking authority to the Commission to establish additional \\nduties for SDRs. The Commission proposed to add several additional \\nduties pursuant to this authority; they are discussed in section II. \\nE, below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Core Principle 2 requires that each SDR establish governance \\narrangements that are transparent to fulfill public interest \\nrequirements and to support the objectives of the Federal government, \\nowners and participants. Core Principle 3 provides that each SDR \\nestablish and enforce rules to minimize conflicts of interest in its \\ndecision-making processes and establish a process for resolving such \\nconflicts. In order to ensure proper implementation of Core Principles \\n2 and 3, the Commission proposed Sec.  49.20 (focusing on the \\ntransparency of SDR governance arrangements) and Sec.  49.21 \\n(addressing SDR identification and mitigation of existing and potential \\nconflicts of interest).\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.20 prescribed minimum standards for the \\ntransparency of SDR governance arrangements and required that the SDR \\nmake available certain information to the Commission and the public \\nthat is current, accurate, clear and readily accessible; and that it \\ndisclose summaries of significant decisions. In addition, proposed \\nSec.  49.20 required each SDR to ensure that an independent perspective \\nbe reflected in the nominations process for its board of directors as \\nwell as the process for assigning members of the board or others to SDR \\ncommittees. Finally, the proposal included a number of substantive \\nrequirements for SDR boards of directors and committees. In \\nimplementing Core Principle 3, the Commission proposed in Sec.  49.21 \\nthat each SDR maintain and enforce rules that would identify and \\nmitigate existing and potential conflicts of interest in its decision-\\nmaking processes.\\n8. Proposed Regulations Relating to Additional Duties\\n    As noted above, section 21(f)(4) provides authority under which the \\nCommission may prescribe additional duties for SDRs. Pursuant to \\nsection 21(f)(4) and section 8a(5) of the CEA, the Commission proposed \\nto include in part 49 four additional duties that would require SDRs to \\n(i) adopt and implement system safeguards, including BC-DR plans; \\\\44\\\\ \\n(ii) maintain sufficient financial resources; \\\\45\\\\ (iii) furnish to \\nmarket participants a disclosure document setting forth the risks and \\ncosts associated with using the services of an SDR; \\\\46\\\\ and (iv) \\nprovide fair and open access to the SDR and fees that are equitable and \\nnon-discriminatory.\\\\47\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\44\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.24.\\n    \\\\45\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.25.\\n    \\\\46\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.26.\\n    \\\\47\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.27.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n9. Proposed Regulations Related to Real-Time Public Reporting\\n    As discussed above, section 727 of the Dodd-Frank Act established \\ncertain public reporting requirements for all swap transactions and \\nparticipants, creating new section 2(a)(13)(B) which establishes the \\nreporting requirements pursuant to which the Commission is authorized \\nto promulgate rules mandating the public availability of swap \\ntransaction and pricing data in ``real time.\\'\\' \\\\48\\\\ To implement these \\nprovisions, the Commission proposed a real-time public reporting \\nframework for swap transaction and pricing data in new part 43 of its \\nRegulations.\\\\49\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.15 details SDRs\\' ability to accept \\nand publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data on a swap \\nmarket as well as those executed off-exchange; its provisions apply to \\noff-facility swap transactions and to all swap transactions executed on \\na SEF or DCM that fulfill the public dissemination requirement of \\nproposed part 43 by reporting to a registered SDR. As proposed, Sec.  \\n49.15 required SDRs to establish electronic reporting systems necessary \\nto receive and publicly disseminate all required data fields and \\nfurther requires SDRs who disseminate swap transaction and pricing data \\nin real time to promptly notify the Commission when such data is not \\ntimely reported.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\48\\\\ Section 2(a)(13)(A) of the CEA defines real-time public \\nreporting to mean ``as soon as technologically practicable after the \\ntime at which the swap transaction has been executed.\\'\\'\\n    \\\\49\\\\ See Real-Time NPRM supra note 28.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n10. Proposed Regulations Relating to Implementation of SDR Rules\\n    Proposed Sec.  40.8 was intended to conform SDR implementation \\nprocedures to the proposed amendments to the Commission\\'s part 40 \\nregulations addressing provisions common to all registered \\nentities.\\\\50\\\\ The proposal provided that an applicant for registration \\nas an SDR may request Commission approval of some or all of its rules \\nor, alternatively, may self-certify its rules. Proposed Sec.  40.8 \\nspecified procedures applicable to both alternatives.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\50\\\\ See Part 40 supra note 21.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nD. Overview of Comments Received <SUP>51</SUP>\\n\\n    The Commission received a total of 29 comments from a broad range \\nof\\n\\n[[Page 54543]]\\n\\ninterested persons, including existing trade repositories and potential \\nSDRs, foreign regulatory authorities, trade organizations, banks, \\ncommercial end-users, and DCMs. While commenters generally expressed \\nsupport for the proposed part 49 rules, they also offered \\nrecommendations for clarification or modification of specific \\nprovisions. Comments generally focused on one or more of a dozen broad \\nthemes, including (i) SDRs as a public utility; (ii) commercialization \\nof data; (iii) indemnification requirements; (iv) monitoring, screening \\nand analyzing swap data; (v) ability of SDRs to invalidate or modify \\nthe terms of an executed swap; (vi) real-time public reporting; (vii) \\npricing; (viii) bundling of services; (ix) registration; (x) governance \\nand conflicts of interest; (xi) access to data; and (xii) \\nimplementation and phase-in.\\\\52\\\\ Individual comments will be described \\nand discussed as appropriate throughout this section.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\51\\\\ The initial comment period with respect to proposed part 49 \\nclosed on February 22, 2011.

These late-filed comment letters \\nwere received very close to the Commission\\'s decision on the final \\npart 49 rules; the letters raised no new issues, and therefore, the \\nCommission is not providing a specific response to any issues raised \\nby the letters.\\n    \\\\52\\\\ The Commission in its SDR NPRM requested comment on the \\nnature and length of any implementation or phase-in period for \\nproposed part 49. Six commenters responded, recommending variously \\nthat there be separate phase-in periods for different asset classes \\nand/or that the Commission sequence the implementation of reporting \\nrules by first implementing parts 45 and 49. Subsequently, when \\nsufficient information is collected to fully study the markets, \\nrules related to real-time and block trading should be implemented. \\nThe Commission has determined to separately address implementation \\nand sequencing issues and will consider and address comments related \\nto those concerns in connection with that action. In addition, 14 \\nadditional comments were received by the Commission in connection \\nwith its request for comment on the order in which it should \\nconsider final rulemakings made under the Dodd-Frank Act. See infra \\nnote 315 for cites to the additional letters.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nII. Part 49 of the Commission\\'s Regulations: The Final Rules\\n\\n    As proposed in the SDR NPRM, part 49 contains provisions governing \\nthe registration and regulation of SDRs. The scope of part 49 is \\nestablished in Sec.  49.1; definitions are contained in Sec.  49.2. \\nProposed Sec. Sec.  49.3-49.4 and 49.6-49.7, along with Form SDR, \\nestablish the procedures and substantive requirements for registration \\nas an SDR. Proposed Sec.  49.5 governs equity interest transfers and \\nSec.  49.8 establishes procedures under which an SDR must implement its \\nrules. Compliance with the statutory duties described in section 21(c) \\nof the CEA is established in Sec.  49.9 and detailed in Sec. Sec.  \\n49.10 through 49.18 and Sec. Sec.  49.23 and 49.24. Core principles \\napplicable to SDRs as outlined in section 21(f) are set forth in \\nSec. Sec.  49.19 through 49.22. Additional duties promulgated pursuant \\nto section 21(f)(4) of the CEA (``Core Principle 4\\'\\') are set forth in \\nSec. Sec.  49.25 through 49.27. Unless otherwise discussed in this \\nsection, the regulations are adopted as proposed.\\n\\nA. Requirements of Registration\\n\\n1. Procedures for Registration--Sec.  49.3\\n    To implement the requirements of section 21(a), the Commission \\nproposed Sec.  49.3 to establish application and approval procedures. \\nProposed Sec.  49.3 required each SDR applicant to file for \\nregistration electronically on proposed Form SDR.\\\\53\\\\ Form SDR would \\nrequire each applicant to provide the Commission with documentation \\nrelating to its business organization, financial resources, \\ntechnological capabilities, and accessibility of services.\\\\54\\\\ The \\nCommission is adopting Sec. Sec.  49.3-49.7 substantially as proposed \\nsubject to the minor modifications discussed below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\53\\\\ This form would be used for initial or provisional \\nregistration as an SDR as well as for any amendments to the \\napplicant\\'s registration status.\\n    \\\\54\\\\ SDR NPRM supra 8 at 80900-80901.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received one comment relating to registration \\ngenerally. CIEBA requested that the Commission clarify that it will \\nregister any qualified applicant as an SDR.\\\\55\\\\ The Commission confirms \\nthat it expects to register any applicant that satisfies the \\nrequirements for registration established in section 21 of the CEA and \\nthis part 49.\\\\56\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\55\\\\ See CL-CIEBA supra note 51.\\n    \\\\56\\\\ In particular, the Commission notes that section 21(B) of \\nthe CEA, as amended by section 728 of the Dodd-Frank Act, expressly \\nprovides that a DCO may register as an SDR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As discussed below, although it received no comments regarding \\nproposed Form SDR, the Commission has determined to make minor \\ntechnical and conforming changes to Form SDR and also to amend certain \\nprovisions of Sec. Sec.  49.3-49.7.\\\\57\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\57\\\\ The Commission in approving applicants for registration as \\nSDRs expects to provide an identifying code that is unique for each \\n``approved\\'\\' SDR in order to provide proper identification for each \\nSDR and the transactions that are reported to it.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(a) Form SDR\\n    The Commission is making certain technical amendments to Form SDR \\nto harmonize, to the extent possible, the SDR registration procedures \\nwith the application procedures for DCMs, DCOs, and SEFs. For example, \\nthe word ``material\\'\\' has been added to the registration instructions \\nto make clear that ``intentional misstatements or omissions of material \\nfact may constitute federal criminal violations.\\'\\' Because the \\nregistration application must be filed electronically, Form SDR as \\nadopted no longer requires the applicant to provide two copies of Form \\nSDR and attached exhibits. Additionally, the Commission revised Item 8 \\nto account for various organizational structures. Moreover, instead of \\nrequesting ``State/Country\\'\\' of the entity\\'s incorporation or filing, \\nthe final Form SDR requests that the applicant note the \\n``Jurisdiction\\'\\' of the organization and list the jurisdictions in \\nwhich the applicant is qualified to do business. This information will \\nassist the Commission in determining whether other domestic and foreign \\nregulators should be contacted during the application process.\\n\\n[[Page 54544]]\\n\\n    Both Sec.  49.3(a)(5) and Form SDR, as adopted, require that an \\nannual amendment on Form SDR be filed within 60 days of the end of each \\nfiscal year rather than on a calendar year basis. The Commission \\nbelieves that this is consistent with the CCO filing provisions set \\nforth in Sec.  49.22 and will provide the Commission with more timely \\nfinancial statements.\\n    The Commission is also making technical amendments to the form to \\neliminate redundant and ambiguous undefined language. For example, the \\nterm ``Applicant\\'\\' is capitalized and is referred to as a proper person \\nto create consistency and references to ``facing page\\'\\' were removed as \\nthis concept was not defined in Form SDR or the regulations.\\n    Form SDR as adopted clarifies that in order to assist the \\nCommission in its review of an application, applicants for registration \\nare encouraged to supplement Form SDR with any additional information \\nthat may be significant to their operation as an SDR. In addition, the \\nCommission in adopting final Form SDR clarifies that SDR applicants \\nmust be mindful that certain information submitted for application \\npurposes may be made available to the public and therefore advises \\napplicant to request confidential treatment, where appropriate, when \\nsubmitting application materials.\\n(b) Provisional Registration\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.3(b) permitted the Commission, upon the \\nrequest of an applicant, to grant provisional registration as an SDR if \\nthe applicant is in substantial compliance with the standards set forth \\nin proposed Sec.  49.3(a)(4).\\\\58\\\\ Because the Commission believed that \\nprovisional registration should not be a permanent part of part 49, \\nproposed regulation 49.3(b) provided for a ``sunset\\'\\' provision so that \\nthe provisional registration provision would terminate 365 days from \\nthe effective date of the proposed regulations. The Commission has \\ndetermined to amend proposed Sec.  49.3(b) to remove this sunset \\nprovision and provide that the Commission may terminate granting new \\nprovisional registrations at a later date.\\\\59\\\\ The Commission believes \\nthat removal of the sunset provision will allow the Commission to fully \\nevaluate applications for registration and provide greater flexibility \\nin establishing compliance deadlines with registration requirements \\nunder Sec.  49.3. The Commission expects to work with applicants to \\nensure that the transition from provisional registration to full \\nregistration is as prompt and seamless as possible.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\58\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.3(a)(4) delineated the standards for \\napproval of an SDR application: The SDR (i) is appropriately \\norganized, and has the capacity, to ensure the prompt, accurate and \\nreliable performance of its functions as an SDR; (ii) can comply \\nwith any applicable provisions of the CEA and regulations \\nthereunder; (iii) can carry out its functions in a manner consistent \\nwith the purposes of section 21 of the CEA; and (iv) can operate in \\na fair, equitable and consistent manner.\\n    \\\\59\\\\ No comments were received in response to the proposed \\nprovisional registration provisions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In its comment letter, DTCC urged that applicants for provisional \\nregistration be required to demonstrate operational capability, real-\\ntime processing, multiple redundancy and robust information security \\ncontrols.\\\\60\\\\ The Commission agrees that SDRs should have sufficient \\noperational capabilities to operate on a 24-hour basis based on a 6-day \\nworking week and accordingly has clarified in Sec.  49.3(b) that in \\nconsidering a grant of provisional registration it will require both \\n(i) a demonstrated ability to substantially comply with the standards \\nestablished in Sec.  49.3(a)(4) and statutory duties and core \\nprinciples; and (ii) demonstrated operational capability, real-time \\nprocessing, multiple redundancy and robust information security \\ncontrols.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\60\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(c) Registration of Existing Registered Entities\\n    Although comments addressing the proposed application and \\nregistration procedures generally indicated satisfaction with the \\nCommission\\'s proposal, CME recommended that DCOs wishing to register as \\nSDRs be given relief from ``duplicative\\'\\' registration and requested \\nthat the Commission adopt an abbreviated notice registration procedure \\nfor registered DCOs in good standing with the Commission.\\\\61\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\61\\\\ See CL-CME supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission acknowledges the merits of CME\\'s suggestion that \\nthere be a process to streamline the application procedures for \\nexisting DCO registrants, and therefore, is adopting a modification to \\nSec.  49.3. The Commission is making a minor revision to Sec.  \\n49.3(a)(3) so that applicants are not subject to unnecessary \\nduplicative review by the staff of the Commission. Specifically, staff \\nin considering an application for registration as an SDR shall include \\nin its review an applicant\\'s past relevant submissions to the \\nCommission and its compliance history. In addition, the Commission \\nbelieves that once it gains experience with the SDR registration \\nprocess it may re-evaluate whether a shortened or ``notice\\'\\' \\nregistration process should be available to existing non-SDR \\nregistrants (such as a DCO) seeking registration as an SDR.\\\\62\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\62\\\\ The Commission notes that the additional cost of providing \\ndocuments that may already be available to the Commission is \\nexpected to be limited to the expense of providing electronic copies \\nof the exhibits set forth in Form SDR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Withdrawal From Registration--Sec.  49.4\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.4(a) outlined the process for withdrawal from \\nregistration and specified that written notice of a request to withdraw \\nbe served at least 90 days prior to the desired effective date of the \\nwithdrawal. The Commission has corrected Sec.  49.4(a) to clarify that \\nnotice must be served at least 60 days prior to the desired effective \\ndate of the withdrawal; this correction achieves consistency with Sec.  \\n49.4(b), which provides that a notice of withdrawal from registration \\nshall be effective on the 60th day after its filing with the \\nCommission.\\n3. Notification of Equity Interest Transfers--Sec.  49.5\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.5 required SDRs to file with the Commission a \\nnotice of the equity interest transfer of ten percent or more, no later \\nthan the business day following the date on which the SDR enters into a \\nfirm obligation to transfer the equity interest. The Commission \\nproposed a ten percent threshold because it believes that a change in \\nownership of such magnitude, even without a corresponding change in \\ncontrol, may have an impact on the operations of the SDR.\\\\63\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\63\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80902, n.25.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received a single comment relating to this provision \\nwhich recommended that the Commission lower the notification threshold \\nfrom ten percent to five percent. The same commenter also urged that \\nthe Commission obtain notification at or prior to the firm commitment \\nto transfer the equity interest.\\\\64\\\\ The Commission has considered \\nthese comments and believes that the notification threshold as proposed \\nis adequate, based on its belief that a ten percent threshold \\nappropriately covers those transfers that may result in significant \\ncontrol or lead to control of the SDR\\'s management.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\64\\\\ See CL-Better Markets supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.5(a) and (c) required filings with the \\nCommission relating to equity transfer notifications and certifications \\nelectronically through dedicated e-mail addresses. The Commission \\nbelieves that future procedures may change, and therefore,\\n\\n[[Page 54545]]\\n\\nis revising these provisions so that SDRs file certain equity transfer \\nnotifications and certifications in a format and manner to be specified \\nby the Secretary of the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission is \\nadopting this provision largely as proposed subject to the modification \\ndescribed above.\\n4. Swap Data Repositories Located in Foreign Jurisdictions--Sec.  49.7\\n    The Commission proposed Sec.  49.7 to enable it to obtain necessary \\nswap data and related books and records maintained by an SDR located \\noutside the United States. As proposed, Sec.  49.7 required each SDR \\nlocated outside the United States to provide an opinion of counsel that \\nthe SDR can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt \\naccess to its books and records and submit to onsite inspection and \\nexamination by the Commission. The Commission believes this provision \\nis necessary because different jurisdictions may have different legal \\nframeworks, which in turn may limit or restrict the Commission\\'s \\nability to receive information from an SDR. An opinion of counsel in \\nthis regard will allow the Commission to better evaluate an SDR\\'s \\ncapability to meet the requirements of registration and ongoing \\nsupervision.\\n    The Commission requested comment on a series of questions relating \\nto registration of a foreign-based SDR.\\\\65\\\\ In response, the Commission \\nreceived several comments regarding the potential for ``duplicative\\'\\' \\nregistration requirements.\\\\66\\\\ With one exception, commenters supported \\na system of cross-registration or ``recognition\\'\\' in order to reduce \\npotential burdens.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\65\\\\ Specifically, the Commission requested comment with respect \\nto whether (i) the registration process for the foreign SDR be any \\ndifferent than the Commission\\'s proposed registration process; (ii) \\nthere are any factors that the Commission should consider to ensure \\nthat an SDR located outside the United States seeking to register as \\nan SDR can, in compliance with applicable foreign laws, provide the \\nCommission with access to the SDR\\'s books and records that are \\nrequired pursuant to proposed Sec.  49.7 and can submit to onsite \\ninspection and examination by the Commission; and (iii) there are \\nany other factors the Commission should consider relating to an SDR \\nlocated outside of the United States See SDR NPRM supra 8 at 80903.\\n    \\\\66\\\\ See CL-DTCC II; CL-Foreign Banks; CL-ESMA; CL-TriOptima; \\nCL-Regis-TR; CL-Reval supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ESMA in particular requested that the Commission consider a \\nrecognition regime in which an SDR located in a foreign jurisdiction \\ncould register with the Commission if (i) the laws and regulations of \\nthe foreign jurisdiction are equivalent to those in the U.S.; and (ii) \\na MOU has been signed by the Commission and the foreign regulator.\\\\67\\\\ \\nESMA suggested that the MOU would ensure access to all information the \\nCommission will need in order to fulfill its statutory duties.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\67\\\\ CL-ESMA supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Reval, however, urged that that all foreign-based SDRs be required \\nto comply with U.S. regulations and procedures, and to physically host \\nthe data in the U.S. or create a daily backup of the data with an \\nentity in the U.S.\\\\68\\\\ DTCC also maintained that foreign-based SDRs \\nshould not be approved by the Commission under reduced registration \\nrequirements \\\\69\\\\ and asserted that an abbreviated or notice \\nregistration procedure for foreign SDRs should be based on a comparable \\nregulatory structure for repositories in the home country of the \\nforeign SDR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\68\\\\ CL-Reval II supra note 51.\\n    \\\\69\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission notes that the Dodd-Frank Act and the CEA do not \\nauthorize the Commission to exempt SDRs located in foreign \\njurisdictions from the registration requirements set forth in section \\n21. At the same time, the Commission is cognizant of the global nature \\nof the swaps market and of concerns regarding regulatory \\nresponsibilities and costs associated with requiring foreign-based SDRs \\nto comply with multiple, separate regulatory regimes. To that end, the \\nCommission expects to consult, cooperate, and exchange information with \\nforeign regulators in connection with the oversight of foreign-based \\nSDRs that are separately registered in jurisdictions outside of the \\nU.S.\\n    The Commission is mindful of the commenters\\' concerns and \\nemphasizes that the extent of the Commission\\'s ability to coordinate \\nwith foreign regulators will depend largely on the comparability and \\ncomprehensiveness of supervision and regulation by the foreign \\njurisdiction in which the SDR is located. In considering the \\nfeasibility of a particular recognition regime, the Commission intends \\nto review regulatory requirements and the supervision or oversight \\nprograms of a ``home\\'\\' or foreign regulator of an SDR to determine the \\nextent to which the Commission potentially could rely on such foreign \\nregulators. The level of cooperation and the extent of any coordination \\nwould be evaluated on an individual basis and would be governed by an \\nMOU. For example, the Commission and the foreign regulator should be \\ncapable of exchanging regulatory reports (including examination \\nreports) and filings, as well as other information applicable to the \\noperation of such entity as an SDR. This exchange of information would \\nassist the Commission in determining whether the SDR located in a \\nforeign jurisdiction is in compliance with duties mandated under part \\n49. Such cooperation or coordination with foreign regulators would not \\nlimit or in any way condition the discretion of the Commission in the \\ndischarge of its regulatory responsibilities.\\n\\nB. Duties of Registered SDRs\\n\\n    Section 21(c) sets forth the minimum duties that an SDR is required \\nto perform to become registered and to maintain registration. These \\nstatutory duties require that SDRs (i) accept swap data as prescribed \\nby the Commission; (ii) confirm with both counterparties to a swap the \\naccuracy of the data; (iii) maintain the data submitted; (iv) provide \\nthe Commission or its designee (including another registered entity) \\nwith direct electronic access to the swap data; (v) provide the \\nnecessary information as prescribed by the Commission to comply with \\nthe public reporting requirements set forth in section 2(a)(13) of the \\nCEA; (vi) establish automated systems for monitoring, screening, and \\nanalyzing swap data; (vii) maintain the privacy or confidentiality of \\nany and all swap data that the SDR receives; (viii) provide access to \\nthe swap data to certain ``appropriate\\'\\' domestic and foreign \\nregulators; and (ix) adopt and implement emergency procedures. In \\naddition, the Commission pursuant to its authority under sections \\n21(f)(4) and 8a(5) \\\\70\\\\ of the CEA proposed that registered SDRs (i) \\nadopt and implement system safeguards, including BC-DR plans; (ii) \\nmaintain sufficient financial resources; (iii) furnish market \\nparticipant with a disclosure document setting forth the risks and \\ncosts associated with using the services of the SDR; and (iv) provide \\nfair and open access and fees and charges that are equitable and non-\\ndiscriminatory.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\70\\\\ Section 8a(5) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 12a(5), authorizes the \\nCommission to promulgate such rules and regulations as, in the \\njudgment of the Commission, are reasonably necessary to effectuate \\nany of the provisions or accomplish any of the purposes of the CEA. \\nIn connection with SDRs, section 21(a)(3)(A)(ii), 7 U.S.C. \\n24a(a)(3)(A)(ii) specifically requires that an SDR to be registered \\nand maintain its registration must comply with any requirement that \\nthe Commission may impose by rule or regulation pursuant to section \\n8a(5) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Acceptance of Data--Sec.  49.10\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.10 required that SDRs adopt policies and \\nprocedures that would enable the SDR to electronically accept data and \\nother regulatory\\n\\n[[Page 54546]]\\n\\ninformation; \\\\71\\\\ accept all swaps in the asset class(es) \\\\72\\\\ for \\nwhich they have registered; \\\\73\\\\ establish sufficient policies and \\nprocedures to prevent a valid swap from being invalidated, altered or \\nmodified through the confirmation or recording process of the SDR; and \\nestablish procedures and provide facilities for effectively resolving \\ndisputes over the accuracy of the swap data and positions that are \\nrecorded in the SDR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\71\\\\ See section 21(c)(1) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 24a(c)(1). The \\nCommission proposed in new part 45 to the Commission\\'s Regulations \\nthe specific data elements that must be reported and applicable to \\nDCMs, DCOs, swap execution facilities (``SEFs\\'\\'), foreign boards of \\ntrade (``FBOTs\\'\\'),1 SDs, MSPs, non-end-user SDs/MSPs and end-users \\nin connection with the reporting of such swap data to SDRs. These \\ndata elements and standards would include the reporting of \\ncontinuation data throughout the life of the swap. In addition, the \\nData NPRM also provides specific requirements for SDRs relating to \\n(i) determining which counterparty must report to the SDR; (ii) \\nthird-party facilitation of swap data reporting; (iii) reporting to \\na single SDR in connection with the reporting of swap data; (iv) \\nrequired data standards; and (v) the reporting of errors and \\nomissions. See Data NPRM supra note 6.\\n    \\\\72\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.2(a)(2) defined ``asset class\\'\\' as those \\nswaps in a particular broad category of goods, services or \\ncommodities underlying a swap. The asset classes include credit, \\nequity, interest rates, currency, other commodities and such other \\nassets as may be determined by the Commission. See also Department \\nof the Treasury, Notice of Proposed Determination of Foreign \\nExchange Swaps and Foreign Exchange Forwards Under the Commodity \\nExchange Act, 76 FR 25774 (May 5, 2011) and Request for Comments: \\nDetermination of Foreign Exchange Swaps and Forwards, 75 FR 66829 \\n(Oct. 29, 2010) and 75 FR 66426 (Oct. 28, 2010).\\n    \\\\73\\\\ As detailed in proposed Sec.  49.27, SDRs would be required \\nto provide fair and open access to their services. The Commission \\nsubmits that SDRs would not be permitted to discriminate in \\nconnection with the access to their services. As a result, market \\nparticipants with sufficient technology resources for connectivity \\nand the payment of fees would be granted access to the services of \\nthe SDR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received one comment relating to the definition of \\nasset class that indicated cross-currency (also known as currency) \\nswaps are not properly characterized under the ``currency\\'\\' asset class \\nbut instead are interest rate products.\\\\74\\\\ Therefore, the Commission \\nbelieves a modification is necessary to better reflect the fact that \\nthe industry typically characterizes \\'\\'currency\\'\\' swaps as ``interest \\nrate swaps.\\'\\' This characterization is based on the attributes of \\ncurrency swaps that resemble the structure and operation exhibited by \\ninterest rate swaps while in ``foreign exchange\\'\\' swaps, the underlying \\nforeign currency is exchanged by the parties. Accordingly, the \\nCommission is replacing the term ``currency\\'\\' in the definition of \\nasset class with ``foreign exchange\\'\\' as set forth in Sec.  49.2(a)(2) \\nto accurately reflect the asset classes employed in the swaps market.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\74\\\\ See CL-Global FX Division supra note 51 at 2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received a single comment relating to data formats \\nand protocols for data submission to SDRs.\\\\75\\\\ DTCC commented that a \\nregistered SDR should have the flexibility to specify the acceptable \\ndata formats, connectivity requirements, and other protocols for \\nsubmitting information.\\\\76\\\\ While the Commission generally agrees with \\nDTCC that SDRs should have flexibility to specify acceptable data \\nformats and other technical requirements, the Commission does not \\nbelieve that DTCC\\'s recommendations are necessary to operational \\nflexibility. Several commenters supported \\\\77\\\\ the proposed requirement \\nin Sec.  49.10(b) that an SDR accept all swaps from any asset class or \\nclasses for which it registers. CME, however, recommended that DCO-SDRs \\nshould only be required to accept data for swaps that they clear and \\nnot for uncleared/bilateral transactions.\\\\78\\\\ The Commission believes \\nthat CME\\'s approach would lead to greater data fragmentation. \\nAdditionally, the Commission believes that pursuant to section \\n2(a)(13)(G), SDRs are required to accept cleared and uncleared swaps. \\nAccordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec.  49.10(b) substantially as \\nproposed, with the addition of the phrase ``unless otherwise prescribed \\nby the Commission\\'\\' so that the Commission may, in its discretion, \\nprovide flexibility to the general rule that an SDR must accept all \\nswaps in an asset class for which it has registered. This flexibility \\nwill be especially relevant in connection with the implementation or \\nphasing of reporting obligations of market participants.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\75\\\\ See CL-DTCC I supra note 51.\\n    \\\\76\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\77\\\\ See CL-Better Markets, CL-DTCC I and CL-Global FX Division \\nsupra note 51.\\n    \\\\78\\\\ See CL-CME supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received four comments relating to proposed Sec.  \\n49.10(c).\\\\79\\\\ The comments were supportive of the Commission\\'s efforts \\nto prevent improper invalidation of swap transactions; as discussed \\nbelow, however, some commenters felt that further refinement of the \\ntext is necessary.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\79\\\\ See CL-ABC/CIEBA, CL-AMG and CL-CIEBA supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ABC/CIEBA and AMG requested that the Commission clarify that Sec.  \\n49.10(c) would prevent an SDR from adopting user agreements that \\nindirectly serve to modify or invalidate terms that have been agreed \\nupon by the counterparties.\\\\80\\\\ The Commission has adopted the \\nrecommended clarification. ABC/CIEBA and AMG also requested that the \\nCommission seek to prevent confirmation and reporting platforms from \\nadopting provisions in their user agreements that would permit the \\nmodification or invalidation without the consent of the \\ncounterparties.\\\\81\\\\ CIEBA also separately suggested that the Commission \\nprohibit SDRs from using third-party service providers which invalidate \\na swap without the consent of a counterparty.\\\\82\\\\ The Commission \\nbelieves that Sec.  49.10(c), as proposed, would clearly prohibit SDRs \\nas well as any agent or third-party service provider of the SDR to \\nmodify or invalidate a swap transaction without the consent of the \\ncounterparties.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\80\\\\ CL-ABC/CIEBA and CL-AMG supra note 51 at 3-4 and 9, \\nrespectively.\\n    \\\\81\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\82\\\\ CL-CIEBA supra note 51 at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Confirmation of Data Accuracy--Sec.  49.11\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.11 required SDRs to establish and adopt \\npolicies and procedures to ensure the accuracy of swap data that is \\nreported to an SDR.\\\\83\\\\ In particular, proposed Sec.  49.11 required \\nthat the SDR confirm with both counterparties to the swap the accuracy \\nof the data and information submitted \\\\84\\\\ and receive acknowledgement \\nof all data submitted as well as corrections of any errors.\\\\85\\\\ The SDR \\nNPRM specified that confirmation is unnecessary when the reporting \\nparty is a SEF, DCM, DCO or a confirmation or matching service provider \\nto whom the swap counterparty has delegated its reporting obligation. \\nHowever, the SDR would still be required to ensure that the data and \\ninformation it receives from such entity is accurate.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\83\\\\ See Data NPRM supra note 6.\\n    \\\\84\\\\ The Data NPRM details and defines ``confirmation\\'\\' and \\n``confirmation data.\\'\\' The term confirmation is proposed in Sec.  \\n45.1(b) to mean ``the full, signed legal confirmation by the \\ncounterparties of all of the terms of a swap.\\'\\' The term \\n``confirmation data\\'\\' is proposed in Sec.  45.1(c) to mean ``all of \\nthe terms of a swap matched and agreed upon by the counterparties in \\nconfirming the swap.\\'\\' See Data NPRM, supra note 6.\\n    \\\\85\\\\ This requirement does not apply to real-time public \\nreporting. See proposed Sec.  43.3(f) supra note 28.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As detailed in proposed part 45, the reporting of swap creation \\ndata (primary economic terms data and confirmation data) and swap \\ncontinuation data will take place through different channels, depending \\non the nature of the transaction and counterparties. Primary economic \\nterms data is required to be reported by a SEF or DCM if the swap is \\nexecuted on a platform, and by the reporting counterparty (SD, MSP, or \\nother counterparty) if the swap is not platform executed. Confirmation \\ndata\\n\\n[[Page 54547]]\\n\\nwill be reported by a DCO if the swap is cleared, and by the reporting \\ncounterparty if the swap is uncleared. Swap continuation data will be \\nreported throughout the life of a swap by the DCO and/or the reporting \\ncounterparty. Consistent with proposed part 45 and Sec.  49.12, SDRs \\nare required to accept swap data from these entities, as well as from \\nthird-party service providers who may be acting on their behalf.\\n    The Commission received five comments relating to an SDR\\'s \\nobligation to confirm the accuracy of the reported swap data.\\\\86\\\\ \\nSeveral commenters recommended that an SDR should not be required to \\naffirmatively communicate with both counterparties in order to confirm \\nthe accuracy of data submitted. Reval commented that the SDR should \\nonly be required to confirm the accuracy of the trade with the \\nreporting entity.\\\\87\\\\ DTCC \\\\88\\\\ and MarkitSERV \\\\89\\\\ both supported the \\nuse of confirmation records in fulfilling the obligation of the SDR to \\nconfirm data submissions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\86\\\\ See CL-Reval II, CL-DTCC I, CL-MarkitSERV I, CL-ABC/CIEBA \\nand CL-Data-Encana supra note 51.\\n    \\\\87\\\\ CL-Reval II supra note 51 at 6.\\n    \\\\88\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 20.\\n    \\\\89\\\\ CL-MarkitSERV I supra note 51 at 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission notes that section 21(c)(2) of the CEA states that \\nan SDR must confirm the accuracy of the data that was submitted with \\nboth counterparties to the swap and does not draw any distinction \\nbetween submitted swap data that has or has not been legally confirmed. \\nHowever, the Commission agrees with the commenters that it may not be \\nnecessary to affirmatively communicate with both counterparties in all \\ncircumstances. Therefore, the Commission has modified the manner in \\nwhich an SDR may fulfill the requirement to confirm the accuracy of the \\ndata. As adopted, Sec.  49.11 will not require an SDR to affirmatively \\ncommunicate with both counterparties when data is received from a SEF, \\nDCM, DCO, or third-party service provider under certain conditions. \\nCommunication need not be direct and affirmative where the SDR has \\nformed a reasonable belief that the data is accurate, the data or \\naccompanying information reflects that both counterparties agreed to \\nthe data, and the counterparties were provided with a 48-hour \\ncorrection period. The SDR must affirmatively communicate with both \\ncounterparties to the swap when data is submitted directly by a swap \\ncounterparty such as an SD, MSP or non-SD/MSP counterparty such as an \\nend-user.\\n    Encana requested that the Commission provide additional guidance on \\nhow proposed Sec.  45.10 and Sec.  49.11 work together. Both \\nregulations impose obligations on reporting parties and SDRs relating \\nto errors and omissions in the reporting of swap transaction data.\\\\90\\\\ \\nThe Commission submits that the regulations are complementary and are \\nboth expected to protect the integrity and the accuracy of reported \\ndata. While Sec.  45.10 provides an ongoing obligation for \\ncounterparties to provide error corrections, Sec.  49.11 imposes a duty \\non the SDR to provide a correction period to receive from \\ncounterparties, within a short time period after the data has been \\nsubmitted, acknowledgment of the accuracy of the data.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\90\\\\ See CL-Encana supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Recordkeeping Requirements--Sec.  49.12\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.12 implements section 21(c)(3) consistent with \\nexisting Commission regulations and the Commission\\'s proposed part 45 \\nregulations \\\\91\\\\ and required that SDRs maintain swap data throughout \\nthe existence of the swap and for five years following termination \\nduring which time the records must be readily accessible by the SDR and \\navailable to the Commission via real-time electronic access and in \\narchival storage capable of being retrieved within three business days.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\91\\\\ See Data NPRM supra note 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received one comment \\\\92\\\\ recommending that swap \\ndata be kept indefinitely.\\\\93\\\\ As proposed, Sec.  49.12(a) required \\nSDRs to maintain books and records as prescribed by proposed Sec.  \\n45.2. Rather than specifically referencing and incorporating the \\nprovisions of proposed Sec.  45.2, the Commission believes Sec.  \\n49.12(a) should require SDRs to comply with any and all recordkeeping \\nprovisions adopted under part 45.\\\\94\\\\ Accordingly, Sec.  49.12(a) as \\nadopted requires registered SDRs to ``maintain books and records in \\naccordance with the requirements of part 45 of this chapter regarding \\nthe data required to be reported to the swap data repository.\\'\\' Under \\nSec.  49.12(a), registered SDRs will be required to maintain swap data \\nfor the time periods and under the standards to be set forth in part \\n45.\\\\95\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\92\\\\ See CL-Barnard supra note 51 at 2.\\n    \\\\93\\\\ The Commission has also received several comments in \\nconnection with the proposed part 45 recordkeeping provisions. \\nComments received in connection with proposed part 45 will be \\nreviewed in connection with that rulemaking; the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  49.12(a) largely as proposed subject to the \\nmodifications discussed below.\\n    \\\\94\\\\ Like other rules that are tied to related rulemakings, \\nSec.  49.12(c) will become effective 60 days after publication in \\nthe Federal Register but compliance will not be required until such \\ntime as the part 45 rules become effective.\\n    \\\\95\\\\ The time period and standards in part 45 are currently \\nproposed as throughout the existence of the swap and for five years \\nfollowing termination during which time the records must be readily \\naccessible by the SDR and available to the Commission via real-time \\nelectronic access and in archival storage capable of being \\nretrievable within three business days.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is revising proposed Sec.  49.12 to require SDRs to \\ncomply with the time periods set forth in part 45 for maintaining books \\nand records. The Commission does not believe that SDRs should be \\nrequired to keep records indefinitely following the expiration of the \\nunderlying transactions.\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.12(c) required all books and records to be open \\nto inspection upon request by any representative of the Commission, the \\nUnited States Department of Justice, the SEC or prudential regulators \\nas authorized by the Commission. The Commission is revising Sec.  \\n49.12(c) to remove the SEC and prudential regulators so that only the \\nCommission and the Department of Justice will have books and records \\ninspection rights.\\\\96\\\\ This change will maintain consistency with \\nexisting Commission regulations on recordkeeping.\\\\97\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\96\\\\ See proposed rule 13n-7 under the Securities Exchange Act \\nof 1934, 17 CFR 240.13n-7 set forth in the SEC\\'s proposal relating \\nto security-based swap data repositories. The SEC in that proposal \\ndid not provide inspection rights of the books and records of a \\nsecurity-based swap data repository to the Commission or prudential \\nregulators. See SEC, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Security-Based \\nSwap Data Repository Registration, Duties and Core Principles, 75 FR \\n77306 (Dec. 10, 2010).\\n    \\\\97\\\\ Commission regulation Sec.  1.31 requires that all ``books \\nand records required to be kept by the act or by these regulations \\nshall be kept for a period of five years from the date thereof and \\nshall be readily accessible during the first 2 years of the 5-year \\nperiod. All such books and records shall be open to inspection by \\nany representative of the Commission or the United States Department \\nof Justice.\\'\\' The Commission notes that section 4r(c) of the CEA \\nadopted by Section 729 of the Dodd-Frank Act provides inspection \\nrights to, among others, the SEC, prudential regulators and the \\nFSOC. However, these rights are limited to counterparties that do \\nnot clear or have their swap transactions reported to, or accepted \\nby, an SDR. Accordingly, the Commission lacks the statutory \\nauthority to provide books and records inspection rights to those \\nnamed other regulators.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that the proper procedure for Appropriate \\nDomestic Regulators to obtain SDR Information is through the mechanism \\nset forth in Sec.  49.17 (Access to SDR Data) discussed below in \\nsection II.B.7.\\n    The Commission is adopting Sec.  49.12(d) largely as proposed, \\nsubject to a slight modification discussed below in connection with \\nSec.  49.15 relating to real-time public reporting requirements.\\n\\n[[Page 54548]]\\n\\n4. Monitoring, Screening and Analyzing Swap Data--Sec.  49.13 and Sec.  \\n49.14\\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  49.13 and 49.14 implement section 21 of the CEA \\nand together reflect SDRs\\' significant responsibilities in the new \\nswaps market regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act. \\nUnder this new regulatory structure, SDRs will function not only as \\nrepositories for swap transaction data, but also as potential sources \\nof support for the Commission\\'s oversight of swaps markets and swap \\nmarket participants. Section 21(c)(5) of the CEA, as amended by section \\n728 of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires SDRs to establish ``automated \\nsystems for monitoring, screening, and analyzing swap data, including \\ncompliance and frequency of end-user clearing exemption claims by \\nindividuals and affiliated entities.\\'\\' \\\\98\\\\ By its terms, section \\n21(c)(5) requires that such automated systems be established ``at the \\ndirection of the Commission,\\'\\' but does not provide for specific \\nfunctions which SDRs should undertake with respect to the swap \\ntransaction data in their possession. The only specific requirement set \\nforth in section 21(c)(5) is that SDRs have systems in place capable of \\nfulfilling such requirements as the Commission may assign.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\98\\\\ Section 21(c)(5) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  49.13 and 49.14 required that SDRs: (1) \\nMonitor, screen, and analyze all swap data in their possession as the \\nCommission may require; (2) develop systems and resources as necessary \\nto execute any monitoring, screening, or analyzing functions assigned \\nby the Commission; and (3) monitor, screen, and analyze swap \\ntransactions which are reported to the SDR as exempt from clearing \\npursuant to section 2(h)(7) of the CEA (i.e., end-user clearing \\nexemption).\\n    The Commission received eight comment letters relating to proposed \\nSec. Sec.  49.13 and 49.14.\\\\99\\\\ While the commenters were generally \\nsupportive of the proposed rules and their objectives, they articulated \\na number of concerns, including: (1) The level of detail concerning \\nroutine and ad hoc monitoring, screening and analysis requirements; (2) \\nfuture compliance costs; and (3) the level of responsibilities imposed \\non SDRs and/or retained by the Commission. Four of the commenters \\\\100\\\\ \\nrequested additional detail and clarity on the anticipated requirements \\nin proposed Sec.  49.13(a) and (b).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\99\\\\ These letters represent comments from five potential SDRs, \\ntwo non-profit organizations, and one individual .

Both AFR and Better Markets believed that \\naggregated data monitoring and analysis should be performed by the \\nCommission rather than relying on SDRs.\\\\106\\\\ CME\\'s comments raised \\nconcerns with providing SDRs with surveillance responsibilities.\\\\107\\\\ \\nDTCC, however, recommended that certain monitoring, screening, and \\nanalyzing functions be performed centrally by an SDR.\\\\108\\\\ Reval \\nrecommended that SDRs be more than a data warehouse and provide data \\nanalysis to the Commission.\\\\109\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\104\\\\ See CL-AFR, CL-Better Markets and CL-CME supra note 51.\\n    \\\\105\\\\ See CL-DTCC I and CL-Reval II supra note 51.\\n    \\\\106\\\\ AFR further suggested that the Commission develop ``the \\ncapacity to perform key data analysis in-house, using raw data from \\nSDRs, instead of becoming dependent on privately owned SDRs to \\nmeasure aggregate exposures.\\'\\' Id. at 4. Better Markets suggested \\nthat the Commission build its own ``single, in-house system\\'\\' for \\nmonitoring and analyzing swap data rather than rely on individual \\nSDRs. CL-Better Markets supra note 51 at 8.\\n    \\\\107\\\\ CME stated that it is ``not convinced that SDRs should be \\ngiven wide ranging surveillance responsibilities.\\'\\' CL-CME supra \\nnote 51 at 5.

Reval suggested that SDRs \\nshould be required to provide an independent valuation of the swaps \\nsubmitted to the SDR, provide the relevant market data that goes \\ninto the calculation of the swap value, verify the credit value \\nadjustment for uncleared trades, and provide the Commission with \\nhistoric, current, and future risk analysis to anticipate systemic \\nrisk. Id. at 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Commenters expressed concern that Sec. Sec.  49.13(a) and 49.14 do \\nnot sufficiently describe the specific tasks SDRs are expected to \\nperform. The Commission recognizes that Sec. Sec.  49.13(a) and 49.14 \\ndo not contain specific requirements. Its intention in Sec. Sec.  \\n49.13(a) and 49.14 is to codify the statutory requirements in section \\n21(c)(5) and establish that specific monitoring, screening, and \\nanalyzing duties will be imposed when its knowledge of the markets is \\nmore fully developed.\\\\110\\\\ At that time, the Commission will provide \\nSDRs with adequate notice to permit them to meet specific requirements \\nof Sec. Sec.  49.13(a) and 49.14.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\110\\\\ See proposed Sec.  49.13(a). SDR NPRM supra note 8 at \\n80907.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Regarding proposed Sec.  49.13(b), the Commission believes that \\nSDRs and other regulated entities should always maintain sufficient \\nresources to comply with regulatory requirements under the CEA. The \\nCommission also recognizes the necessity for adequate resource \\nrequirements for SDRs given the expectation that SDRs may play a \\nsignificant role in assisting the Commission to fulfill its regulatory \\nmandate. Therefore, the Commission has not implemented Sungard\\'s \\nsuggestion to impose a cap on the growth of required information \\ntechnology, staff, and other resources required under Sec.  49.13(b). \\nThe Commission also notes that the requirement of Sec.  43.13(b) to \\n``establish and maintain sufficient information technology, staff, and \\nother resources\\'\\' is similar to provisions proposed and already \\nexisting for DCMs and proposed for SEFs.\\\\111\\\\ Furthermore, any \\nincreased\\n\\n[[Page 54549]]\\n\\nregulatory functions covered by proposed Sec.  49.13(b), which may \\nresult in increase costs, will apply to all SDRs equally. As discussed \\nabove, the Commission has also committed to giving sufficient notice \\nbefore imposing specific obligations under Sec. Sec.  49.13 and 49.14, \\ngiving SDRs time to also address any resulting financial needs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\111\\\\ See Core Principle 2, Acceptable Practices, in appendix B \\nto part 38 of the Commission\\'s regulations. The Application Guidance \\nfor this Core Principle requires designated contract markets to \\n``have arrangements and resources for effective trade practice \\nsurveillance programs\\'\\' and ``have arrangements, resources and \\nauthority for effective rule enforcement.\\'\\' 17 CFR 38, appendix B. \\nSee also proposed Sec.  38.155(a) which requires a designated \\ncontract market to ``establish and maintain sufficient compliance \\ndepartment resources and staff to ensure that it can conduct \\neffective audit trail reviews, trade practice surveillance, market \\nsurveillance, and real-time market monitoring.\\'\\' 75 FR 80572, 80613 \\n(Dec. 22, 2010)(``DCM NPRM\\'\\'). See also proposed Sec.  37.203(c)(1) \\nwhich requires a swap execution facility to ``establish and maintain \\nsufficient compliance department resources and staff to ensure that \\nit can conduct effective audit trail reviews, trade practice \\nsurveillance, market surveillance and real-time market monitoring.\\'\\' \\nCommission, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Core Principles and Other \\nRequirements for Swap Execution Facilities, 76 FR 1214, 1241 (Jan. \\n7, 2011)(``SEF NPRM\\'\\').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    AFR, Better Markets and CME recommended that the Commission play a \\nlarger role than proposed in the monitoring, screening, and analyzing \\nof swap market data. Both AFR and Better Markets, in particular, \\nrecommended that the Commission build its own systems for monitoring, \\nscreening and analyzing swap data. The Commission believes that the \\nproper role of an SDR is to provide the Commission with a centralized \\nrecordkeeping facility to facilitate its surveillance and oversight \\nresponsibilities in the swaps markets. The Commission does not propose \\nthat SDRs displace the Commission\\'s regulatory responsibilities, but \\nneither does it propose to displace SDRs statutory obligations to \\nmonitor, screen and analyze swap market data. The Commission largely \\nagrees with AFR and Better Markets in that the Commission should retain \\nthe responsibility for surveillance and oversight of the swaps market; \\nhowever, the Commission believes it is unnecessary to duplicate systems \\nthat will already be available through the SDR infrastructure. \\nAdditionally, the Commission believes that SDRs, at the direction of \\nthe Commission, will provide sufficient capacity for monitoring, \\nscreening, and analyzing swap data. The Commission believes that the \\napproach of proposed Sec. Sec.  49.13 and 49.14 adequately balances the \\nCommission\\'s regulatory responsibilities with SDRs statutory duties \\nand, as articulated by DTCC, ``promotes efficiency in the system.\\'\\' \\n\\\\112\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\112\\\\ CL-DTCC supra note 51 at 24.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Commenters also made recommendations relating to uniform \\nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements across different SDRs. The \\nCommission notes that it addressed this issue in a separate, related, \\nrulemaking.\\\\113\\\\ Nonetheless, the Commission does not agree with Better \\nMarkets that it must also require SDR systems to be uniform and \\ncompatible. The Commission believes that its designation of uniform \\nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements will sustain a level of system \\ncompatibility. In addition, when established, the monitoring, \\nscreening, and analyzing tasks required of SDRs will likely impose a \\nlevel of uniformity of system outputs within similarly situated SDRs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\113\\\\ See Data NPRM supra note 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Lastly, the Commission agrees with Reval\\'s assertion that in order \\nto minimize systemic risk, SDRs need to engage in certain data analysis \\nand reporting rather than function merely as warehouses of transaction \\ndata. However, as articulated above, at this time the Commission has \\nnot proposed, nor is it implementing, specific data analysis functions \\nfor SDRs. The Commission intends to consider additional specific tasks \\nto be performed by SDRs when its knowledge and experience of the \\nregulatory oversight needs with respect to the swap markets has \\ndeveloped more fully.\\n    With the clarifications and modifications described above, the \\nCommission is adopting Sec. Sec.  49.13 and 49.14 substantially as \\nproposed.\\\\114\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\114\\\\ The Commission is making two non-substantive modifications \\nto Sec. Sec.  49.13(a) and 49.14. The word ``perform\\'\\' will be added \\nto the last sentence in Sec.  49.13(a) and the word ``of\\'\\' will be \\nadded to the last sentence in Sec.  49.14. These modifications are \\nbeing made to improve the sentence structure of both of these \\nsections.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n5. Real-Time Public Reporting--Sec.  49.15\\n    Section 2(a)(13)(D) of the CEA permits the Commission to require \\nregistered entities to publicly disseminate swap transaction and \\npricing data. To implement section 2(a)(13), the Commission is \\nestablishing a real-time public reporting framework in a new part 43 of \\nthe Commission\\'s regulations that is subject to a separate \\nrulemaking.\\\\115\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\115\\\\ See Real-Time NPRM supra note 28. As noted above, \\nSec. Sec.  49.12(d) and 49.15 will become effective 60 days from the \\ndate of publication in the Federal Register, but compliance will not \\nbe required until such time as the part 43 rules become effective. \\nSee note 93 supra.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.12(d) and Sec.  49.15 together set forth the \\nrequirements for SDRs regarding the public dissemination of swap \\ntransaction and pricing data. Proposed Sec.  49.12(d) required each SDR \\nto comply generally with the requirements prescribed in part 43, while \\nproposed Sec.  49.15 described additional duties of an SDR relating to \\nthe acceptance and public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing \\ndata in real-time.\\n    The Commission received a total of seven comments relating to \\nproposed Sec. Sec.  49.12(d) and 49.15.\\\\116\\\\ Markit and Argus urged the \\nCommission to adopt tighter restrictions on the commercial non-public \\ndissemination of real-time data,\\\\117\\\\ while Markit also recommended \\nthat the part 43 rules explicitly state that ownership of swap \\ntransaction data does not transfer from counterparties to other \\nregulated entities such as DCMs, SEFs and DCOs.\\\\118\\\\ AMG and AII both \\nrequested that the Commission phase-in block size determinations and \\ntime-limits for real-time dissemination.\\\\119\\\\ NFPE Coalition also \\nrequested a clarification regarding aspects of the real-time reporting \\nrequirements and suggested that SDRs should not be used to determine \\nthe timeliness of real-time public reporting.\\\\120\\\\ ICE and DTCC \\nbelieved that SDRs should be designated as the sole vehicle for the \\ndissemination of swap data \\\\121\\\\ while DTCC also expressed the concern \\nthat public dissemination could disclose the identities of swap \\ncounterparties.\\\\122\\\\ Better Markets also recommended that the \\nCommission have real-time streaming or instantaneous access to swap \\ntransaction data in order to fulfill its regulatory obligations.\\\\123\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\116\\\\ See CL-Markit, CL-AMG, CL-Argus, CL-AII, CL-NFPE \\nCoalition, CL-DTCC I and CL-DTCC II supra note 51.\\n    \\\\117\\\\ CL-Markit and CL-Argus supra note 51.\\n    \\\\118\\\\ CL-Markit supra note 51.\\n    \\\\119\\\\ CL-AMG and CL-AII supra note 51.\\n    \\\\120\\\\ CL-NFPE Coalition supra note 51.\\n    \\\\121\\\\ CL-Data-ICE, CL-DTCC I and CL-DTCC II supra note 51.\\n    \\\\122\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51.\\n    \\\\123\\\\ CL-Better Markets supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is adopting Sec.  49.15 substantially as proposed. \\nAs adopted, Sec.  49.15(a) will no longer limit the real-time reporting \\nof swap transactions for SDRs to ``off facility swaps.\\'\\' The Commission \\nis currently considering comments received in connection with the \\nproposed part 43 regulations,\\\\124\\\\ including those relating to an SDR\\'s \\nrole in the public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data \\nin real time. The Commission may include limitations on the type of \\npublic reporting and dissemination for SDRs. As adopted, Sec.  \\n49.15(c), relating to the untimely submission of swap data for real-\\ntime public reporting and dissemination purposes will not reference the \\nspecific time periods and notification procedures proposed in part 43. \\nInstead, Sec.  49.15(c) will require SDRs to ``notify the Commission of \\nany swap transaction for which the real-time swap data was not received \\nby the swap data repository in accordance with part 43 of\\n\\n[[Page 54550]]\\n\\nthis chapter.\\'\\' The Commission believes this change provides \\nappropriate flexibility to adjust SDR responsibilities with regard to \\nthe untimely reporting of swap transaction data in accordance with any \\nfuture adoption of part 43. The Commission will consider the comment \\nreceived in connection with proposed Sec.  49.15(c) when addressing the \\nrelevant provisions in part 43, which is expected to be finalized \\nsubsequent to this rulemaking.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\124\\\\ Real-Time NPRM supra note 28.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In response to comments received \\\\125\\\\ concerning the commercial \\nuse of real-time public swap data and the commercialization of data \\ngenerally, the Commission submits that persons responsible \\\\126\\\\ for \\nthe public dissemination of swap data are prohibited from distributing \\nsuch data prior to public dissemination. Such pre-publicly available \\ndissemination would constitute a ``commercial use\\'\\' under Sec.  \\n49.17(g). Therefore, SDRs may not make commercial use of real-time swap \\ndata before dissemination to the public, including any analysis for \\ncommercial purposes. As set forth in 49.17(g)(1), the Commission also \\nnotes that SDRs must maintain appropriate firewalls to protect swap \\ndata from unlawful commercial uses.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\125\\\\ See CL-Markit and CL-Argus supra note 51.\\n    \\\\126\\\\ Although SDRs are permitted to delegate the performance of \\nvarious functions to 3rd party service providers, the SDR retains \\nthe responsibility for compliance with this and other regulatory \\nrestrictions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Additionally, as discussed above, in light of the comments received \\nand as a result of its consideration of proposed Sec.  49.15, the \\nCommission will continue to consider the role SDRs will play in the \\npublic dissemination of real-time swap data and will address these \\nissues in the context of the part 43 rules.\\n6.

See also FTC, Final \\nRule: Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information, 67 FR 36484 \\n(May 23, 2002).\\n    \\\\128\\\\ According to such ``core principle,\\'\\' each SDR shall \\n``establish and enforce rules to minimize conflicts of interest in \\n[its] decision-making process * * *\\'\\' and ``establish a process for \\nresolving conflicts of interest. See infra section II D. 4.\\n    \\\\129\\\\ See section 21(f)(3) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 24a(f)(3).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section 21(c)(6) of the CEA provides that an SDR shall ``maintain \\nthe privacy of any and all swap transaction information that the swap \\ndata repository receives from an SD, counterparty, or any other \\nregistered entity.\\'\\' Section 21(f)(3) of the CEA also sets forth a \\nconflict of interest ``core principle\\'\\' applicable to an SDR. As \\ndetailed further below, the Commission has identified certain conflicts \\nthat may implicate access, disclosure, or use of SDR Information.\\\\130\\\\ \\nSDR Information includes any information that an SDR receives from a \\nreporting counterparty,\\\\131\\\\ including market participants \\\\132\\\\ such \\nas DCMs, DCOs, SEFs, SDs, MSPs and non-SD/MSP counterparties.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\130\\\\ The term ``SDR Information\\'\\' is defined in proposed Sec.  \\n49.2(a)(15) to mean ``any information that the swap data repository \\nmaintains.\\'\\' Sec.  49.17(f) and (g) discussed below contain more \\nspecific prohibitions on access or use of SDR Information.\\n    \\\\131\\\\ The term ``reporting counterparty\\'\\' is set forth in \\nproposed Sec.  45.5 of the Data Rulemaking NPRM. The proposed \\ndefinition is based on section 4r(3) of the CEA.\\n    \\\\132\\\\ The term ``market participant\\'\\' is defined in proposed \\nSec.  49.2(a)(6) to mean any person participating in the swap \\nmarket, including, but not limited to, DCMs, DCOs, SEFs, SDs, MSPs, \\nand any other counterparties to a swap transaction.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission emphasizes that SDRs are expected to receive two \\nseparate ``streams\\'\\' of data: (i) Data related to real-time public \\nreporting which by its nature is publicly available and (ii) data that \\nis intended for use by the Commission and other regulators which is \\nsubject to statutory confidential treatment (``Core Data\\'\\'). \\nAccordingly, pursuant to sections 21(c)(6) and 21(f)(3) (Core Principle \\n3--Conflicts of Interest) of the CEA, SDR information that is not \\nsubject to real-time public reporting should be treated as non-public \\nand held strictly confidential such that it may not be accessed, \\ndisclosed, or used for purposes not related to SDR responsibilities \\nunder the CEA or the regulations thereunder, unless such use is \\nexplicitly agreed to by the reporting entities. However, aggregated \\ndata that cannot be attributed to individual transactions or market \\nparticipants may be disclosed by an SDR on a voluntary basis or as \\nrequired by the Commission.\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.16 required SDRs to establish, maintain, and \\nenforce specific policies and procedures to protect the privacy or \\nconfidentiality of any and all SDR Information, including privacy or \\nconfidentiality policies and procedures for the sharing of SDR \\nInformation with SDR affiliates \\\\133\\\\ as well as certain non-affiliated \\nthird parties.\\\\134\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.16 also required SDRs to \\nestablish and maintain safeguards, policies, and procedures that would, \\nat a minimum, address the misappropriation or misuse of swap data that \\nthe Commission is prohibited (save for limited exceptions) from \\ndisclosing Section 8 Material.\\\\135\\\\ As discussed, Section 8 Material is \\nthat information or material described in section 8(a) of the CEA that \\nthe Commission is prohibited from publishing if it ``would separately \\ndisclose the business transactions or market positions of any person \\nand trade secrets or names of customers.\\'\\' \\\\136\\\\ Such information would \\ntypically\\n\\n[[Page 54551]]\\n\\ninclude trade data, position data, business transactions, trade secrets \\nand any other non-public personal information about a market \\nparticipant or any of its customers. Moreover, proposed Sec.  49.16 \\nrequired an SDR to also protect information that is not Section 8 \\nMaterial as well as intellectual property that may include trading \\nstrategies.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\133\\\\ The term ``affiliate\\'\\' is defined in proposed Sec.  \\n49.2(a)(1) to mean a person that ``directly, or indirectly, \\ncontrols, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the \\nswap data repository.\\'\\'\\n    \\\\134\\\\ The term ``non-affiliated third party\\'\\' is defined in \\nproposed Sec.  49.2(a)(7) to mean ``any person except (i) swap data \\nrepository, (ii) the swap data repository\\'s affiliate, or (iii) a \\nperson employed by a swap data repository and any entity that is not \\nthe swap data repository\\'s affiliate (and ``non-affiliated third \\nparty\\'\\' includes such entity that jointly employs the person).\\'\\'\\n    \\\\135\\\\ The term ``Section 8 Material\\'\\' is defined in proposed \\nSec.  49.2(a)(13) as ``the business transactions, trade data, or \\nmarket positions of any person and trade secrets or names of \\ncustomers.\\'\\' The legislative history of section 8 of the CEA \\nreflects substantial Congressional concern with protecting the \\nlegitimate interests of certain market participants. In particular, \\nCongressional members were concerned that ``bona fide hedging \\ntransactions\\'\\' and ``legitimate\\'\\' or ``necessary\\'\\' speculative \\ntransactions would be impracticable if disclosure of positions or \\ntransactions was permitted. Congress was also concerned that \\npublication of the names and market positions of large traders would \\nfacilitate manipulation and place traders at a competitive \\ndisadvantage. See generally 61 Cong. Rec. 1321 (1921); Regulation of \\nGrain Exchanges, Hearing on H.R. 8829 Before the H. Comm. on \\nAgriculture, 73rd Cong. (1934).\\n    \\\\136\\\\ Section 8(a) of the CEA outlines the scope and authority \\nof the Commission to publish or otherwise publicly disclose \\ninformation that is gathered in the course of its investigative and \\nmarket surveillance activities. While the section authorizes the \\nCommission to publish or disclose the information obtained through \\nthe use of its powers, it expressly provides that, except in \\nspecifically prescribed circumstances, the Commission may not \\nlawfully: publish data and information that would separately \\ndisclose the business transactions or market positions of any person \\nand trade secrets or names of customers. * * *\\n    7 U.S.C. 12(a).\\n    The statutory bar to disclosure of ``business transactions, \\nmarket positions and trade secrets\\'\\' is qualified by several \\nnarrowly-defined exceptions set forth in section 8(e) of the CEA. 7 \\nU.S.C. 12(e). Section 8(e) generally provides that ``upon request,\\'\\' \\nthe CFTC may furnish ``any information\\'\\' in its possession \\n``obtained in connection with its administration of the [CEA]\\'\\' to \\nanother U.S. government department or agency, individual states, \\nforeign futures authorities and foreign governments and any \\ncommittee of the U.S. Congress that is ``acting within the scope of \\nits jurisdiction.\\'\\' Section 8(b) of the CEA permits disclosure of \\nSection 8 Material in connection with certain congressional, \\nadministrative or judicial proceedings. In addition, section 8(e) \\nalso provides an exception for information that was previously \\ndisclosed publicly pursuant to section 8.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission submits that these SDR safeguards, policies, and \\nprocedures addressing privacy and confidentiality--as well as misuse \\nand misappropriation--of data should provide (i) limitations on access \\nrelated to Section 8 Material and other SDR Information; (ii) standards \\nrelated to controlling persons associated with the SDR trading for \\ntheir personal benefit or the benefit of others; and (iii) adequate \\noversight to ensure SDR compliance with Sec.  49.17. As set forth in \\nSec.  49.17 discussed below in the section entitled ``Access to SDR \\nData,\\'\\' an SDR may share swap data and information with certain \\n``appropriate\\'\\' domestic and foreign regulators. Commercial use of the \\ndata maintained by an SDR--exclusive of real-time reporting data--is \\nstrictly circumscribed as provided in Sec.  49.17. As noted above, swap \\ndata that is publicly disseminated in real-time by SDRs pursuant to \\nproposed part 43 of the Commission\\'s Regulation would not be subject to \\nthe privacy and confidentiality requirements set forth in Sec.  49.16.\\n    The Commission received two comments relating to privacy and \\nconfidentiality concerns.\\\\137\\\\ DTCC specifically supported the \\nCommission\\'s efforts to keep swap data reported to SDRs confidential \\nbut noted the possibility of unintentional disclosure of participant \\nidentities in connection with the public dissemination of swap data. \\nThe concern raised by DTCC focused on the perceived potential for \\nmarket participants to extrapolate identities of counterparties to a \\ntransaction that is publicly reported pursuant to the real-time public \\nreporting requirements. The Commission, however, believes that the \\nmanner in which real-time public reporting will occur pursuant to part \\n43 will mitigate this concern because counterparty identities will not \\nbe disclosed and the actual underlying notional amount will not be \\nassociated with any particular transaction. MFA similarly believes that \\nthe requirements of Sec.  49.16 may not be sufficient to protect the \\nconfidentiality of trading positions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\137\\\\ See CL-DTCC I and CL-MFA supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission agrees with MFA that the confidentiality of position \\nlevel data held by an SDR is extremely important and notes that Sec.  \\n49.16, as proposed, would require that each SDR ``[e]stablish and \\nmaintain safeguards, policies, and procedures reasonably designed to \\nprevent the misappropriation or misuse, directly or indirectly, of: (i) \\nSection 8 Material; (ii) other SDR Information; and/or Intellectual \\nproperty * * *\\'\\' \\\\138\\\\ Accordingly, the Commission believes that this \\nrequirement covers the matters that MFA proposed for inclusion in Sec.  \\n49.16. ``Section 8 Material\\'\\' as defined in proposed Sec.  49.2(a)(11) \\nmeans the ``business transactions, trade data or market positions of \\nany person and trade secrets or names of customers.\\'\\' The details of \\nany master agreements governing a swap would clearly fall within a \\n``business transaction\\'\\' referenced in the definition of Section 8 \\nMaterial.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\138\\\\ Proposed Sec.  49.16(a)(2) set forth in SDR NPRM supra \\nnote 51 at 80931.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In connection with MFA\\'s desire to have the legal standard of care \\nset forth in Sec.  49.16, the Commission submits that SDRs, rather than \\nthe Commission, are in the better position to establish appropriate \\nprocedures to protect the confidentiality of SDR data consistent with \\nSec.  49.16. In addition, the Commission believes that MFA\\'s \\nrecommendation to hold current and former SDR employees, directors, \\nofficers, agents and representatives liable by regulation for any \\nbreach of the SDR\\'s privacy policies and procedures is beyond the scope \\nof section 21(c)(6). Consistent with MFA\\'s comments, the Commission \\nbelieves that SDRs must be prohibited, as a condition of accepting data \\nfrom reporting entities, from requiring the waiver of any legal rights \\nsuch entities may have with respect to breaches of confidentiality by \\nthe SDR. The Commission also received comments on confidentiality and \\naggregated data from DTCC, which was concerned that market participants \\nmay be able to identify the parties to a particular transaction through \\nextrapolation even though the disclosed data is ``aggregated.\\'\\' \\\\139\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\139\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In order to clarify its position with respect to the disclosure of \\n``aggregated data,\\'\\' the Commission believes that it is permissible \\nunder the Dodd-Frank Act and part 49 of the Commission\\'s regulations \\nfor an SDR to disclose, for non-commercial purposes, data on an \\naggregated basis such that the disclosed data reasonably cannot be \\nattributed to individual transactions or market participants. In \\naddition, the Commission submits that if requested by the Commission, \\nan SDR would be required to disclose aggregated data in such form and \\nmanner as the Commission prescribes.\\n    Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec.  49.16 largely as \\nproposed with the addition of (i) paragraph (b) to clarify that an SDR \\nis prohibited from requiring a waiver of a reporting entity\\'s legal \\nrights for breaches of confidentiality by the SDR or affiliated \\nentities; and (ii) paragraph (c) to clarify that SDRs may disclose \\naggregated data voluntarily or as requested by the Commission.\\n7. Access to SDR Data--Sec.  49.17\\n(a) Definition of Appropriate Domestic Regulator\\n    As detailed in the SDR NPRM, the Commission in proposed Sec.  49.17 \\nspecifically included the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (``FRBNY\\'\\') \\nas an ``Appropriate Domestic Regulator\\'\\' because section 21(c)(7) of \\nthe CEA does not specifically provide for the sharing of information \\nbetween an SDR and the FRBNY. The Commission believes that only \\nincluding the FRBNY as an Appropriate Domestic Regulator is overly \\nrestrictive, and therefore, is revising the definition of ``Appropriate \\nDomestic Regulator\\'\\' to include any ``Federal Reserve Bank.\\'\\' \\\\140\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\140\\\\ The Commission notes that the expansion of ``Appropriate \\nDomestic Regulator\\'\\' to include any Federal Reserve Bank will serve \\nto ensure that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \\n(``FRB\\'\\') will be able to effectively and efficiently perform its \\nstatutory responsibilities as prescribed by the Federal Reserve Act \\n(``FRA\\'\\').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(b) Commission Access\\n    As detailed in the SDR NPRM, a critical function and responsibility \\nof an SDR is to provide ``direct electronic access\\'\\' to the Commission \\nor its designee, which could include another registered entity.\\\\141\\\\ \\nThe Commission in Sec.  49.17(b)(3) defined the term ``direct \\nelectronic access\\'\\' as ``an electronic system, platform or framework \\nthat provides internet or web-based access to real-time swap \\ntransaction data.\\'\\' The Commission believes that a clarification to the \\ndefinition of ``direct electronic access\\'\\' is necessary to include\\n\\n[[Page 54552]]\\n\\n``scheduled data transfers to the Commission\\'s electronic systems.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\141\\\\ See section 21(c)(4)(A) of the CEA. The term ``registered \\nentity\\'\\' is defined in section 1a(40) of the CEA to include (i) a \\nboard of trade designated as a contract market under section 5 of \\nthe CEA; (ii) a DCO registered under section 5b of the CEA; (iii) a \\nSEF registered under section 5h of the CEA; (iv) an SDR registered \\nunder section 21 of the CEA; and (v) with respect to a contract that \\nthe Commission determines is a significant price discovery contract, \\nany electronic trading facility on which the contract is executed or \\ntraded. 7 U.S.C. 1a(40).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received seven comments on direct electronic \\naccess.\\\\142\\\\ Although most commenters were generally supportive of the \\nCommission\\'s approach, a few objected to certain provisions of Sec.  \\n49.17(c) as proposed.

Should the Commission require periodic \\nelectronic transfer of data as an alternative? If so, how often \\nshould such transfer occur (e.g., hourly, a few times a day, every \\nfew days, once a week)?\\'\\' SDR NPRM supra note 51 at 80906.\\n    \\\\144\\\\ CL-AFR and CL-Better Markets supra note 51 at 3 and 7-8, \\nrespectively.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In response to a Commission request \\\\145\\\\ for comment relating to \\nthe most cost-effective method or manner in providing direct electronic \\naccess, Reval stated that SDRs should be required to provide the \\nCommission with internet browser-based access to a hosted SDR solution. \\nConsistent with Reval\\'s comments, the Commission believes that an \\ninternet or Web-based method to access reported swap data held and \\nmaintained by SDRs would be the least disruptive and most efficient \\nprocess.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\145\\\\ The Commission in the SDR NPRM requested the comment on \\nthe following: ``What would be the most feasible and cost-effective \\nmethod for an SDR to provide direct electronic access to the \\nCommission or its designee?\\'\\' SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80906.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    DTCC noted its experience with the Trade Information Warehouse for \\nOTC credit derivatives \\\\146\\\\ and recommended that the Commission permit \\nSDRs to adopt in their discretion the manner and method of providing \\ndata sets to the Commission. The Commission believes that the manner \\nand method of obtaining access to the swap data held by SDRs is the \\nfunction and prerogative of the Commission and should not be left to \\nthe judgment or discretion of the SDR and its management. In connection \\nwith its separate comment letter responsive to the Data NPRM, DTCC also \\nasserted that the Commission should allow sufficient reporting \\nflexibility. As set forth above, the Commission does not believe that \\nSDRs should have the discretion or ability to determine the appropriate \\ndata sets that should be provided to the Commission.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\146\\\\ CL-DTCC II supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    CME stated that it is impractical to provide Commission staff with \\naccess identical to that provided to the SDR\\'s CCO because of technical \\nconsiderations.\\\\147\\\\ CME also disagreed with the premise of ``direct \\nelectronic access\\'\\' set forth in Sec.  49.17(c), maintaining that SDRs \\nshould not be required to provide ``proprietary\\'\\' systems to the \\nCommission without compensation and without adequate assurances that \\nthe swap data would remain confidential. Moreover, CME asserted that \\n``real-time\\'\\' electronic access to the swap data maintained by an SDR \\nis not necessary.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\147\\\\ CL-CME supra note 51 at 5-6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission disagrees with CME\\'s view regarding Commission \\ndirect electronic access. As stated previously, section 21(c)(4)(A) of \\nthe CEA mandates that SDRs provide the Commission (or any Commission \\ndesignee) with direct electronic access.\\\\148\\\\ Accordingly, the \\nCommission submits that this requirement to provide the Commission with \\ndirect electronic access is not qualified or at the discretion of the \\nSDR. With respect to CME\\'s concern relating to improper disclosure of \\nconfidential swap data, the Commission notes that section 8 of the CEA \\nprohibits the Commission from disclosing information ``that would \\nseparately disclose the business transactions or market positions of \\nany person and trade secrets or names of customers.\\'\\' \\\\149\\\\ \\nAccordingly, the Commission believes that CME\\'s comments are \\nunwarranted and should not serve to limit direct electronic access by \\nthe Commission and its staff.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\148\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\149\\\\ See 7 U.S.C. 12(a). The statutory bar to disclosure of \\n``business transactions, market positions and trade secrets\\'\\' is \\nqualified by several narrowly-defined exceptions set forth in \\nsection 8(e) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    NFPE Coalition commented that the Commission should not have access \\nto entity data submitted by non-financial entities, including the \\nidentity of such entities, unless they engage in swaps to the extent \\nthat their exposure could pose a systemic risk. The Commission notes \\nthat the Dodd-Frank Act generally provides regulators with the ability \\nto monitor and oversee the swaps markets by reviewing and analyzing the \\ndata to be held by SDRs. The Commission submits that the ability to \\nreview and analyze all swap transactions (whether by a financial or \\nnon-financial entity) is essential in order for the entire market to be \\nsufficiently monitored and analyzed. The Commission does not agree with \\nthe NFPE Coalition\\'s view that non-financial entity transactions should \\nremain confidential given the direct statutory requirements in section \\n21(c)(6) of the CEA that SDRs ``maintain the privacy of any and all \\nswap transaction information that the swap data repository receives \\nfrom a swap dealer, counterparty, or any other registered entity.\\'\\'\\n    Based on the analysis set forth above relating to proposed Sec.  \\n49.17(c) and an SDR\\'s statutory duty to provide the Commission or its \\ndesignee with direct electronic access, the Commission is adopting \\nSec.  49.17(c) as proposed. In addition, as discussed above, the \\nCommission is also adopting a minor revision to the definition of \\n``direct electronic access\\'\\' set forth in Sec.  49.17(b)(3) to clarify \\nthat ``direct electronic access\\'\\' would include ``scheduled data \\ntransfers to Commission\\'s electronic systems.\\'\\'\\n(c) Other Regulator Access to SDR Data\\n    Section 21(c)(7) \\\\150\\\\ of the CEA requires a registered SDR, on a \\nconfidential basis pursuant to section 8 of the CEA, upon request and \\nafter notifying the Commission, to make available all data \\\\151\\\\ \\nobtained by the registered SDR, to ``Appropriate Domestic Regulators\\'\\' \\nand ``Appropriate Foreign Regulators.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\150\\\\ Section 21(c)(7) of the CEA reads:\\n    A swap data repository shall--* * * on a confidential basis \\npursuant to Section 8, upon request, and after notifying the \\nCommission of the request, make available all data obtained by the \\nswap data repository, including individual counterparty trade and \\nposition data, to--(A) each appropriate prudential regulator; (B) \\nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council; (C) the Securities and \\nExchange Commission; (D) the Department of Justice; and (E) any \\nother person that the Commission determines to be appropriate. * * *\\n    7 U.S.C. 24a(c)(7).

As proposed, the definition of \\n``Appropriate Foreign Regulator\\'\\' has two parts or elements. First, \\nSec.  49.17(b)(2) defines an Appropriate Foreign Regulator as those \\n``foreign regulators\\'\\' \\\\152\\\\ with an existing MOU or\\n\\n[[Page 54553]]\\n\\nother similar type of information sharing arrangement executed with the \\nCommission. Second, Sec.  49.17(b)(2) provides that foreign regulators \\nwithout an MOU with the Commission may be deemed ``Appropriate Foreign \\nRegulators\\'\\' as determined on a case-by-case basis by the Commission. \\nAccordingly, Sec.  49.17 as proposed set forth detailed filing \\nprocedures for foreign regulators who do not currently have an MOU with \\nthe Commission to obtain the status of ``Appropriate Foreign \\nRegulator.\\'\\' The Commission received no comments relating to the \\nproposed definition of Appropriate Domestic Regulator and Appropriate \\nForeign Regulator. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec.  \\n49.17(b) as proposed.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\152\\\\ The term ``foreign regulator\\'\\' is defined in proposed \\nSec.  49.2(a)(4) to mean ``a foreign futures authority as defined in \\nsection 1a(26) of the Commodity Exchange Act, foreign financial \\nsupervisors, foreign central banks and foreign ministries.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The procedure for Appropriate Domestic Regulators or Appropriate \\nForeign Regulators to gain access to the data held and maintained by an \\nSDR was detailed in proposed Sec.  49.17(d). First, an Appropriate \\nDomestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator is required to \\nrequest access with the registered SDR in sufficient detail so that the \\nSDR is able to determine the basis of the request. As part of this \\nrequest, the Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign \\nRegulator must also certify (i) its statutory authority; and (ii) that \\nit is acting within the scope of its jurisdiction. The registered SDR \\nmust then notify the Commission promptly by electronic means of any \\nrequest received from an Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate \\nForeign Regulator. As proposed, the registered SDR will then provide \\naccess to the requested swap data if satisfied that the Appropriate \\nDomestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator is acting within \\nthe scope of its authority.\\n    The Commission received one comment from the OCC expressing concern \\nthat SDRs would serve a ``gate keeping\\'\\' function relating to regulator \\naccess.\\\\153\\\\ OCC maintained that SDRs should not be permitted to \\nquestion the statutory authority of a regulator to receive swaps data \\nmaintained by the SDR. Although other commenters \\\\154\\\\ did not \\nspecifically comment on the procedure set forth in Sec.  49.17(d) \\nrelating to regulators\\' access, these commenters generally indicated \\nthat SDRs should operate in a manner that would freely provide \\ninformation to regulators. These commenters viewed the purpose of SDRs \\nas one of assisting regulators in fulfilling their regulatory \\nobligations. The theme of these comments is that SDRs should serve as \\nan impartial vehicle for assisting regulators.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\153\\\\ CL-OCC supra note 51.\\n    \\\\154\\\\ See CL-DTCC I, CL-TriOptima, CL-Regis--TR and CL-ESMA \\nsupra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Upon review of the comments received and the access procedure \\ngenerally, the Commission believes that other regulator access \\n(Appropriate Domestic Regulator and Appropriate Foreign Regulators) \\nshould not be constrained or limited by SDRs. Therefore, the Commission \\nis revising proposed Sec.  49.17(d) so that Appropriate Domestic \\nRegulator and Appropriate Foreign Regulators when filing a request for \\naccess are only required to certify that they are acting within the \\nscope of their jurisdiction. As proposed, Sec.  49.17(d)(i) required \\nthe Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator to \\nset forth in sufficient detail the basis for its request. The \\nCommission is eliminating this requirement in Sec.  49.17(d) as \\nadopted. In addition, proposed Sec.  49.17(d)(3) required an SDR to \\nprovide access to the requested swap data ``if satisfied that the \\nAppropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator is \\nacting within the scope of its authority.\\'\\' The Commission is also \\nrevising proposed Sec.  49.17(d)(3) so that Appropriate Domestic \\nRegulators\\' and Appropriate Foreign Regulators\\' access to SDR swap data \\nis provided once the SDR notifies the Commission of the request.\\n(d) Confidentiality and Indemnification Agreement\\n    For the purpose of implementing section 21(c)(7) and (d) of the \\nCEA, the Commission proposed Sec.  49.18. Consistent with section \\n21(d),\\\\155\\\\ Sec.  49.18, as proposed, provided that an Appropriate \\nDomestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator prior to receipt of \\nany requested data or information from a registered SDR must execute a \\n``Confidentiality and Indemnification Agreement\\'\\' with the registered \\nSDR. The Commission further provided in proposed Sec.  49.18 that an \\nAppropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator must \\nnotify and provide a copy of the Confidentiality and Indemnification \\nAgreement to the Commission.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\155\\\\ Section 21(d) of the CEA provides:\\n    Before the swap data repository may share information with any \\nentity described in subsection (c)(7)-(1) the swap data repository \\nshall receive a written agreement from each entity stating that the \\nentity shall abide by the confidentiality requirements described in \\nSection 8 relating to the information on swap transactions that is \\nprovided; and (2) each entity shall agree to indemnify the swap data \\nrepository and the Commission for any expenses arising from \\nlitigation related to the information provided under section 8.\\n    7 U.S.C. 24a(d).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.18 required that the Confidentiality and \\nIndemnification Agreement executed with each Appropriate Domestic \\nRegulator and/or Appropriate Foreign Regulator provide that such entity \\nabide by the confidentiality requirements set forth in section 8 of the \\nCEA relating to the swap data that is to be provided by the registered \\nSDR. Moreover, the Confidentiality and Indemnification Agreement must \\nprovide that each section 21(c)(7) entity agree to indemnify the \\nregistered SDR and the Commission for any expenses arising from \\nlitigation relating to the information provided under section 8 of the \\nCEA. The Commission received four comments \\\\156\\\\ relating to the \\nconfidentiality and indemnification agreement requirement and/or \\ninformation sharing among regulators.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\156\\\\ See CL-DTCC I, CL-TriOptima, CL-ESMA and CL-Foreign Banks \\nsupra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    DTCC stated that proposed Sec.  49.18 is not consistent with the \\nOTC Derivatives Regulators\\' Forum (``ODRF\\'\\') \\\\157\\\\ guidelines which \\ngenerally provide that ``[a]uthorities, including central banks, \\nprudential supervisors, resolution authorities and market regulators, \\nwith a material interest in [credit derivatives] information in \\nfurtherance of their regulatory and/or governmental responsibilities \\nshould have unfettered access to the relevant data, irrespective of the \\nlocation of the trade repository.\\'\\' \\\\158\\\\ Accordingly, DTCC recommended \\nthat the indemnification provisions of section 21(d) as proposed in \\nSec.  49.18 should not apply where regulators are carrying out \\nregulatory responsibilities, acting in a manner consistent with \\ninternational agreements and maintaining the confidentiality of the \\ndata.\\\\159\\\\ With this recommendation, DTCC requested the\\n\\n[[Page 54554]]\\n\\nCommission together with other global regulators provide ``model \\nindemnity language\\'\\' for use by all repositories or SDRs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\157\\\\ ODRF includes representatives from central banks, \\nprudential supervisors and market regulators from over 20 countries \\nglobally.

Although not specific to the \\nindemnification provision, the Foreign Banks also commented that \\nregulators should support cross-border information sharing efforts so \\nthat a complete picture of the overall swaps market is available for \\nsupervision and surveillance purposes.\\\\162\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\160\\\\ CL-TriOptima supra note 51 at 3-4.\\n    \\\\161\\\\ CL-ESMA supra note 51.\\n    \\\\162\\\\ CL-Foreign Banks supra note 51 at 7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is mindful that the Confidentiality and \\nIndemnification Agreement requirement set forth in section 21(d) and \\nSec.  49.18 may be difficult for certain domestic and foreign \\nregulators to execute with an SDR due to various home country laws and \\nregulations. We note in this regard that section 752 of the Dodd-Frank \\nAct seeks to ``promote effective and consistent global regulation of \\nswaps\\'\\' and provides that the CFTC and foreign regulators ``may agree \\nto such information-sharing arrangements as may be deemed to be \\nnecessary or appropriate in the public interest * * *.\\'\\' In light of \\nthis statutory directive, the Commission continues to work to provide \\nsufficient access to SDR data to appropriate domestic and foreign \\nregulatory authorities.\\n    The Commission believes that, under the circumstances described \\nbelow, certain Appropriate Domestic Regulators may be provided access \\nto the swap data reported and maintained by SDRs without being subject \\nto the notice and indemnification provisions of section 21(c)(7) and \\n(d).\\\\163\\\\ First, the SDR must be subject to the regulatory \\njurisdiction, and register with, the Appropriate Domestic Regulator. \\nSecond, consistent with section 21(c)(4)(A) of the CEA, the SDR would \\nbe permitted to provide direct electronic access to such Appropriate \\nDomestic Regulator as a designee of the Commission.\\\\164\\\\ Under these \\ncircumstances, the Appropriate Domestic Regulator would be provided \\ndirect electronic access to the SDR subject to the same terms and \\nconditions as would apply to the Commission.\\\\165\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\163\\\\ Pursuant to the directive set forth in section 712(a) of \\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, 15 U.S.C. 8302, the Commission has interpreted \\nthis provision as providing the basis to permit access to the swap \\ndata maintained by SDRs to Appropriate Domestic Regulators that have \\nconcurrent regulatory jurisdiction over such SDRs, without the \\napplication of the notice and indemnification provisions of sections \\n21(c)(7) and (d) of the CEA, respectively. As indicated above, the \\nSDR, among other things, must be subject to the regulatory \\noversight, and be registered with, the Appropriate Domestic \\nRegulator.\\n    \\\\164\\\\ As part of such designation, the Commission would require \\nan Appropriate Domestic Regulator to enter into a MOU or similar \\ntype of information sharing arrangement with the Commission. See \\nsection 8(e) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 12(a).\\n    \\\\165\\\\ The Commission notes that certain SDRs are likely to \\nregister with both the Commission and the SEC because the same \\nentity will offer its services for both swaps and security-based \\nswaps. In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \\nSystem currently supervises the Warehouse Trust, the global \\nrepository for credit derivatives. The Commission expects Warehouse \\nTrust to register with the Commission as an SDR and continue to be a \\nmember of the Federal Reserve System, thereby, subject to the \\nconcurrent jurisdiction of the Commission and the Board of Governors \\nof the Federal Reserve System.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In connection with foreign regulatory authorities, the Commission \\nbelieves that confidential swap data reported to, and maintained, by an \\nSDR may be appropriately accessed by an Appropriate Foreign Regulator \\nwithout the execution of a Confidentiality and Indemnification \\nAgreement when the Appropriate Foreign Regulator is acting in a \\nregulatory capacity with respect to a SDR that is also registered with \\nthe Appropriate Foreign Regulator.\\\\166\\\\ In such dual-registration \\ncases, the Appropriate Foreign Regulator may receive information \\ndirectly from the SDR without notice to the Commission and/or the \\nexecution of the Confidentiality and Indemnification Agreement, subject \\nto applicable statutory confidentiality provisions set forth in section \\n8 of the CEA.\\\\167\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\166\\\\ See section 752 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 15 U.S.C. 8325. \\nConsistent with the directive in section 752 to ``promote effective \\nand consistent global regulation of swaps,\\'\\' the Commission does not \\ninterpret the notice and indemnification provisions set forth in \\nsections 21(c)(7) and (d) of the CEA to apply in circumstances in \\nwhich an Appropriate Foreign Regulator possesses independent \\nsovereign legal authority to obtain access to the information and \\ndata held and maintained by an SDR.\\n    \\\\167\\\\ See Written Testimony of Gary Gensler, Chairman of the \\nCommission, before the U.S House Committee on Financial Services on \\nJune 16, 2011 available at <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opagensler-86.html\">http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opagensler-86.html</a> and letter from Gary Gensler, \\nChairman of the Commission, and Mary Schapiro, Chairman of the SEC, \\nto Michael Barnier, European Commissioner for Internal Markets and \\nServices, European Commission, dated June 8, 2011.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Lastly, The Commission notes that the notice and indemnification \\nrequirements set forth in section 21(c)(7) and (d) of the CEA would not \\napply when the Commission, pursuant to section 8(e) of the CEA, shares \\nconfidential information in its possession obtained in connection with \\nthe administration of the CEA to ``any foreign futures authority, \\ndepartment or agency of any foreign government or any political \\nsubdivision thereof\\'\\' acting within the scope of their jurisdiction. \\nThus, Appropriate Foreign Regulators may, pursuant to section 8(e), \\nreceive SDR Information from the Commission without the execution of \\nthe Confidentiality and Indemnification Agreement.\\n    Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec.  49.18 as revised to \\nprovide that SDRs that are dually-registered with the Commission and an \\nAppropriate Domestic or Foreign Regulator may provide access without \\nthe execution of a Confidentiality and Indemnification Agreement. The \\nCommission is similarly revising Sec.  49.17(d), as noted above, so \\nthat Appropriate Domestic and Foreign Regulators with regulatory \\nresponsibilities over SDRs are not required to file data access \\nrequests with their regulated repository or SDR.\\n(e) Third-Party Service Providers Employed by SDRs\\n    The Commission in the SDR NPRM recognized that SDRs from time to \\ntime may contract with third parties in order to fulfill certain \\noperational and data-related obligations. Data access to a third-party \\nservice provider may be especially important in connection with certain \\ntechnology and infrastructure services.\\n    The Commission received one comment letter relating to proposed \\nSec.  49.17(e). MFA was concerned that Sec.  49.17(e) may not be \\nsufficient to protect data and information held and maintained by SDRs \\nfrom improper disclosure.\\\\168\\\\ MFA recommended that the Commission \\nrequire the confidentiality procedures between an SDR and a third-party \\nservice provider to follow the same standard of care and protocol that \\napplies to an SDR\\'s obligation to protect confidential swap \\ninformation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\168\\\\ CL-MFA supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission agrees with MFA\\'s recommendation and accordingly has \\nrevised Sec.  49.17(e) to require that any ``Confidentiality \\nAgreement\\'\\' between an SDR and a third party include a provision that \\nthe third-party service provider have the same or equivalent \\nconfidentiality procedures as the SDR outlined in Sec.  49.16.\\n\\n[[Page 54555]]\\n\\n(f) Counterparty Access to SDRs\\n    The Commission proposed Sec.  49.17(f) to generally prohibit access \\nto the swaps data maintained by a registered SDR by market \\nparticipants, such as SDs and MSPs, unless the specific data was \\noriginally submitted by such party. The underlying basis for this \\nregulation was to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of the \\nreported data while also limiting potential access to reported swap \\ndata to the rightful parties to a swap.\\n    The statutory authority for proposed Sec.  49.17(f) is two-fold. \\nFirst, section 21(c)(6) of the CEA requires registered SDRs to maintain \\nthe privacy of any and all swap transaction information that the \\nregistered SDR receives from an SD, counterparty, or any other \\nregistered entity. Second, section 21(f)(3) \\\\169\\\\ of the CEA requires \\nan SDR to establish and enforce rules to mitigate conflicts of \\ninterest.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\169\\\\ See infra section II.D.4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received two comment letters relating to Sec.  \\n49.17(f). ABC/CIBEA noted that Sec.  49.17(f), as proposed, generally \\nprohibits access to swap data maintained by an SDR subject to an \\nexception permitting access ``* * * if the specific data was originally \\nsubmitted by such party.\\'\\' \\\\170\\\\ ABC/CIEBA asserts that this provision \\nwould only include the reporting party, and therefore, recommended the \\nCommission revise Sec.  49.17(f) so that the exception provides \\n``[d]ata and information related to a particular swap that is \\nmaintained by the registered swap data repository may be accessed by \\neither counterparty to that particular swap.\\'\\' \\\\171\\\\ The Global FX \\nDivision similarly indicated that Sec.  49.17(f) should be modified to \\npermit both counterparties to a swap to view the reported data that is \\nheld and maintained by such SDR.\\\\172\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\170\\\\ CL-ABC/CIEBA supra note 51.\\n    \\\\171\\\\ CL-ABC/CIEBA supra note 51 at 6.\\n    \\\\172\\\\ CL-Global FX Division supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Based on the comments noted above, the Commission is adopting Sec.  \\n49.17(f) largely as proposed with a revision to Sec.  49.17(f)(2) to \\nallow both counterparties to a swap to access information held and \\nmaintained at an SDR for that particular swap.\\n(g) Commercial Use of Data\\n    The Commission in the SDR NPRM proposed Sec.  49.17(g) to generally \\nprohibit an SDR from using the data it accepts and maintains for \\ncommercial or business purposes. As part of this prohibition, Sec.  \\n49.17(g) required a registered SDR to adopt and implement adequate \\n``firewalls\\'\\' to protect the swaps data from any improper, commercial \\nuse. Proposed Sec.  49.17(g)(2) provided for a limited exception to the \\ncommercial use prohibition if the submitters of the data provide \\nexpress written consent to the SDR that its reported data can be used \\nfor commercial purposes. The statutory basis for Sec.  49.17(g), as \\nproposed, is established in sections 21(c)(6) and 21(f)(3) of the \\nCEA.\\\\173\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\173\\\\ See section 728 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section 21(c)(6) provides that an SDR shall ``maintain the privacy \\nof any and all swap transaction information that the swap data \\nrepository receives from a swap dealer, counterparty, or any other \\nregistered entity.\\'\\' As indicated in the SDR NPRM, SDRs are expected to \\nreceive two separate ``streams\\'\\' of data: (i) Data related to real-time \\npublic reporting which by its nature is publicly available; and (ii) \\n``core\\'\\' regulatory data that is intended for use by the Commission and \\nother regulators which is subject to statutory confidential treatment \\n(``Core Data\\'\\'). Accordingly, SDR Information that is not subject to \\nreal-time public reporting should be treated as non-public and subject \\nto the prohibitions on commercial use set for in proposed Sec.  \\n49.17(g). In this manner, the Core Data could not be accessed, \\ndisclosed, or used for purposes not related to SDR responsibilities \\nunder the CEA or the regulations thereunder, unless such use is \\nexplicitly agreed to by the submitters of the data.\\n    Section 21(f)(3) of the CEA, Core Principle 3, also provides that \\neach SDR must establish and enforce rules to minimize conflicts of \\ninterest in the decision-making process of the SDR and to establish a \\nprocess for resolving such conflicts.\\\\174\\\\ Because of the inherent \\nconflicts in connection with maintaining swap data and SDR operations \\n(e.g., the incentive to develop ancillary services using swap data), \\nthe Commission proposed that ``commercial use\\'\\' of any data submitted \\nand maintained by an SDR must be severely restricted. The Commission \\nwas also concerned that an SDR may attempt to use this limited \\n``commercial use\\'\\' exception as a precondition for accepting non-SD/\\nnon-MSP, SD and/or MSP swap transactions. Accordingly, proposed Sec.  \\n49.27 required registered SDRs to provide fair, open and equal access \\nto its services and must not discriminate against submitters of data \\nregardless of whether such a submitter has agreed to any ``commercial \\nuse\\'\\' of its data. The Commission received a total of six comment \\nletters relating to the commercialization of data.\\\\175\\\\ Each of these \\ncomments is discussed in turn below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\174\\\\ See section 21(f)(3) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 24a(f)(3) as \\nadded by section 728 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\\n    \\\\175\\\\ See CL-Markit, CL-CME, CL-Argus, CL-DTCC I, CL-DTCC II and \\nCL-Better Markets supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Markit sought clarification regarding the application of proposed \\nSec.  49.17(g) to the (i) preservation of data ownership rights and \\n(ii) the permissible uses of data by an SDR.\\\\176\\\\ Markit recommended \\nthat regulations relating to the real-time reporting of swap data make \\nclear that swap data ownership does not transfer to the SEF, DCM or any \\nother regulated entity, as appropriate.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\176\\\\ CL-Markit I supra note 51 at 2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that (i) counterparty ``consent\\'\\' to real-\\ntime reporting proposed in part 43 does not provide consent under \\nproposed Sec.  49.17(g) adequate to permit an SDR to use such Core Data \\nfor commercial purposes; and (ii) regulated entities responsible for \\nthe public dissemination of real-time swap data should be restricted \\nfrom making commercial use of that data prior to public dissemination. \\nThe Commission does not agree with Markit\\'s suggestion that the \\ncommercial use of real-time data by SDRs requires the consent of the \\ndata owners but, as discussed, has modified Sec.  49.17(g)(3) to \\nprohibit SDRs from making commercial use of real-time data before \\ndisseminating such data publicly.\\n    CME commented that the Commission should adopt more stringent \\nrequirements to protect commercialization of data received from any \\nentity. Accordingly, CME recommended the Commission revise proposed \\nSec.  49.17(g) so that: (i) The SDR must receive express written \\nconsent before commercializing any data received, whether the entity is \\na swap counterparty or other registered entity (such as a DCO); (ii) \\nthe term ``market participant\\'\\' should apply more broadly than just to \\ncounterparties; and (iii) information submitted by a DCO to an SDR \\nshould not be considered to be aggregated data exempt from the \\ncommercialization prohibition.\\\\177\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\177\\\\ CL-CME supra note 51 at 4-5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission shares the CME\\'s view that information submitted to \\nan SDR by a registered entity, such as a DCO, is not aggregated data \\nexempt from the commercialization prohibition.\\n    The Commission notes that the definition of ``market participant\\'\\' \\nset forth in proposed Sec.  49.2(a)(6) applies to various registered \\nentities such as DCMs, DCOs and SEFs and, therefore, is not limited to \\nswap counterparties.\\n\\n[[Page 54556]]\\n\\nHowever, in terms of proposed Sec.  49.17(g) and the underlying privacy \\nprovision related to SDRs set forth in section 21(c)(6) of the CEA, the \\nCommission agrees with the CME\\'s recommendation for additional clarity \\nregarding market participants that are able to consent to the \\ncommercial use of data. Therefore, consistent with CME\\'s comment, the \\nCommission is revising proposed Sec.  49.17(g) by replacing the term \\n``market participant\\'\\' with the language of section 21(c)(6) of the CEA \\nwhich states ``swap dealer, counterparty, or any other registered \\nentity.\\'\\'\\n    Argus commented that proposed Sec.  49.17(g) may not be sufficient \\nto prevent the indirect commercial use of confidential data held by an \\nSDR. In its role of collecting and disseminating information for real-\\ntime reporting of swap transactions, Argus believes that SDRs may seek \\nto ``monetize\\'\\' or commercially use ``real-time\\'\\' data.\\n    The Commission believes that Sec.  49.17(g) adequately protects \\nswap data reported to an SDR from improper disclosure to affiliates of \\nthe SDR and other third parties. In particular, the Commission notes \\nthat Sec.  49.17(g)(1) specifically requires that an SDR ``adopt and \\nimplement adequate `firewalls\\' to protect the data required to be \\nmaintained under Sec.  49.12 of this part and section 21(b) of the Act \\nfrom any improper, commercial use.\\'\\' \\\\178\\\\ As a preliminary matter, the \\nCommission believes that adequate controls or firewalls would require \\nSDR staff that is involved with any commercial use of real-time data to \\nbe restricted from obtaining access to any Core Data. The Commission \\ndoes not support Argus\\' recommendation that would prohibit the \\ncommercial use of real-time data by an SDR if such SDR has access to \\nnon real-time data.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\178\\\\ 17 CFR 49.17(g)(1).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    DTCC commented that data reported and maintained by SDRs should not \\nbe ``commercialized.\\'\\' \\\\179\\\\ As a result, DTCC believes that a \\nprohibition against commercial uses or practices relating to commercial \\nuse of SDR data will lead to a more cost efficient and less risky swap \\nmarket. DTCC also submitted that SDRs should provide open access to \\noffered services while preserving trading parties\\' control over the \\nreported data maintained by the SDR.\\\\180\\\\ Accordingly, DTCC believes \\nthat the particular SDR for which a trade is reported should be based \\non the counterparty\\'s selection and not by a SEF, DCO, confirmation \\nfacility or other service provider.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\179\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 3.\\n    \\\\180\\\\ CL-DTCC II supra note 51 at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission generally agrees with DTCC\\'s views relating to \\ncommercialization of data. However, with respect to the selection of \\nthe SDR by the reporting counterparty,\\\\181\\\\ the Commission notes that \\nthe reporting counterparty may contractually delegate its decision to \\nan agent such as a SEF, DCO, confirmation facility or other service \\nprovider. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe Sec.  49.17(g) \\nrequires a revision on this point.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\181\\\\ See proposed Sec. Sec.  45.5-45.7 of the Commission\\'s \\nRegulations set forth in the Data NPRM supra note 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Better Markets asserted that if the SDR uses data for ``commercial \\npurposes\\'\\' the SDR must be required to provide the data to the public \\non equal terms as to price, priority and speed of transmittal.\\\\182\\\\ The \\nCommission believes that generally the reporting counterparty may \\nconsent to the commercial use of its data without an additional \\nrequirement on an SDR to provide such data access to the public on \\nequal terms.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\182\\\\ Id. at 13.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission continues to believe that conflicts are inherent in \\nthe reporting and maintaining of swap data by SDRs, and submits that \\nthe ``commercial use\\'\\' of Core Data should be restricted. However, as \\nnoted above, an SDR could, consistent with section 8 of the CEA, \\ncommercially use swap data that was reported on a real-time basis \\npursuant to proposed part 43 of the Commission\\'s Regulations. However, \\nthe Commission notes that an SDR would be in violation of Sec.  \\n49.17(g) and if it were to require the express consent of a market \\nparticipant to use any reported data held and maintained by the SDR as \\na condition for the reporting of such swap transaction data. \\nAccordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec.  49.17(g) largely as \\nproposed subject to the revisions noted above.\\n8. Emergency Authority Procedures and System Safeguards--Sec. Sec.  \\n49.23 and 49.24\\n    Section 21(c)(8) of the CEA requires SDRs to ``establish and \\nmaintain emergency procedures, backup facilities, and a plan for \\ndisaster recovery that allows for the timely recovery and resumption of \\noperations and the fulfillment of the responsibilities and obligations \\nof the organization.\\'\\' Proposed Sec.

For SDRs determined by the Commission to be ``critical,\\'\\' \\n\\\\187\\\\ proposed Sec.  49.24(e)\\n\\n[[Page 54557]]\\n\\nrequired that they (i) implement a disaster recovery plan and BC-DR \\nresources sufficient to enable a same-day recovery time objective in \\nthe event that its normal capabilities become inoperable, including a \\nwide-scale disruption; and (ii) maintain geographic dispersal of \\ninfrastructure and personnel sufficient to enable achievement of a \\nsame-day recovery time objective, in the event of a wide-scale \\ndisruption.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\187\\\\ The Commission in Sec.  49.24 has not defined a \\n``critical\\'\\' SDR, but instead, believes a determination of \\n``critical\\'\\' is a fact-intensive analysis. However, the Commission \\nsubmits that a ``critical\\'\\' SDR would be an SDR that is integral to \\nthe swaps market generally or based on a particular asset class. \\nGenerally, the Commission will evaluate each SDR on a case-by-case \\nbasis, giving consideration to whether the SDR provides essential \\nreporting and other services (such as swap confirmation and/or risk \\nmanagement) that is integral to the swaps market. Because of the \\nnature of the swaps market and the essential reporting and \\nmaintenance of accurate data, the Commission is likely to view \\n``critical\\'\\' on a collective rather than individual basis. The \\nCommission may also consider other relevant factors that it finds \\nimportant such as whether a single or select number of SDRs maintain \\nthe vast majority of swap transaction data.

The Commission received one comment from Chris \\nBarnard regarding proposed Sec.  49.24(j).\\\\188\\\\ Barnard, in connection \\nwith proposed recordkeeping requirements, indicated his view that \\nproposed Sec.  49.24(j) should be amended so that SDRs are required to \\nkeep system safeguard records indefinitely. The Commission notes that \\napart from the specific recordkeeping for reported swap transactions \\nset forth in proposed Sec.  49.12, the general recordkeeping \\nrequirements set forth in Sec.  1.31 of the Commission Regulation\\'s \\nwould apply to BC-DR testing records.\\\\189\\\\ The Commission believes that \\nSec.  1.31 subjects SDRs to adequate record retention requirements for \\nBC-DR testing, and therefore, has not adopted Barnard\\'s recommendation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\188\\\\ CL-Barnard supra note 51 at 2.\\n    \\\\189\\\\ Sec.  1.31(a)(1) specifically provides that ``[a]ll books \\nand records required to be kept by the Act or by these regulations \\nshall be kept for a period of five years from the date thereof and \\nshall be readily accessible during the first 2 years of the 5-year \\nperiod.

Designation of Chief Compliance Officer--Sec.  49.22\\n\\n    Section 21(e) of the CEA, as amended by section 728 of the Dodd-\\nFrank Act, establishes the position of CCO and enumerates specific \\nresponsibilities for CCOs at all SDRs. Section 21(e) contains three \\nparts, which, taken together, establish CCOs as the focal points for \\nSDRs\\' compliance with the CEA and applicable Commission regulations. \\nSection 21(e) requires, first, that every SDR designate an individual \\nto serve as CCO.\\\\190\\\\ Second, it enumerates specific duties for CCOs \\nand establishes their responsibilities within an SDR.\\\\191\\\\ Third, it \\noutlines the requirements of a mandatory annual report from SDRs to the \\nCommission, which must be prepared and signed by an SDR\\'s CCO.\\\\192\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\190\\\\ See section 21(e)(1) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 24a(e)(1).\\n    \\\\191\\\\ See section 21(e)(2) of the CEA, adopted as part of the \\nDodd-Frank Act, providing that a CCO shall:\\n    (A) report directly to the board or to the senior officer of the \\nswap data repository; (B) review the compliance of the swap data \\nrepository with respect to the requirements and core principles \\ndescribed in this section; (C) in consultation with the board of the \\nswap data repository, a body performing a function similar to the \\nboard of the swap data repository, or the senior officer of the swap \\ndata repository, resolve any conflicts of interest that may arise; \\n(D) be responsible for administering each policy and procedure that \\nis required to be established pursuant to this section; (E) ensure \\ncompliance with this Act (including regulations) relating to \\nagreements, contracts, or transactions, including each rule \\nprescribed by the Commission under this section; (F) establish \\nprocedures for the remediation of noncompliance issues identified by \\nthe chief compliance officer through any--(i) compliance office \\nreview; (ii) look-back; (iii) internal or external audit finding; \\n(iv) self-reported error; or (v) validated complaint; and (G) \\nestablish and follow appropriate procedures for the handling, \\nmanagement response, remediation, retesting, and closing of \\nnoncompliance issues.\\n    7 U.S.C. 24a(e)(2).\\n    \\\\192\\\\ See section 21(e)(3)(A) of the CEA, adopted as part of the \\nDodd-Frank Act, providing that a CCO shall:\\n    [A]nnually prepare and sign a report that contains a description \\nof--(i) the compliance of the swap data repository of the chief \\ncompliance officer with respect to this Act (including regulations); \\nand (ii) each policy and procedure of the swap data repository of \\nthe chief compliance officer (including the code of ethics and \\nconflict of interest policies of the swap data repository).

Proposed Sec.  49.22(a) defined the term ``board \\nof directors.\\'\\' Proposed Sec.  49.22(b) set forth the requirement that \\neach SDR must appoint a CCO, and detailed the minimum qualifications \\nfor the CCO. Proposed Sec.  49.22(c) provided for the supervisory \\nstructure that the CCO is subject to within an SDR. Proposed Sec.  \\n49.22(d) enumerated the duties and responsibilities of the CCO. \\nProposed Sec. Sec.  49.22(e) and (f) detailed the information that must \\nbe included in the annual compliance report and set forth the process \\nby which this report must be submitted to the Commission. Lastly, \\nproposed Sec.  49.22(g) detailed the recordkeeping requirements that \\nthe swap data repository must follow in relation to compliance matters \\nand the annual compliance report that is submitted to the Commission.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\193\\\\ See SDR NPRM supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission requested comment on a number of issues relating to \\nproposed Sec.  49.22. Of particular note were two issues relating to \\nthe appointment and supervisory structure of the CCO. Due to concerns \\nabout potential conflicts of interest, the Commission requested comment \\non whether a CCO should be permitted to also serve as the general \\ncounsel of an SDR or as a member of the SDR\\'s legal department. The \\nCommission also requested comment on any additional measures that could \\nbe required of an SDR to adequately protect CCOs from undue influence \\nin the performance of their duties.\\\\194\\\\ These issues, and any comments \\nreceived, are discussed in greater detail below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\194\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80914.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received six comments relating to the SDR\\'s CCO \\nprovisions, including three from potential SDRs, one from an operator \\nof a number of registered DCMs, one from a public interest \\norganization, and one from a private individual.\\\\195\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\195\\\\ The potential SDR commenters included: TriOptima, Reval \\nand DTCC. The public interest organization commenter was Better \\nMarkets and the private individual commenter was Chris Barnard. CME \\nsubmitted a comment letter on behalf of the four DCMs which it \\noperates. See CL-TriOptima, CL-Reval, CL-DTCC I, CL-Better Markets, \\nCL-Barnard and CL-CME supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In response to persuasive arguments by various commenters, Sec.  \\n49.22 as adopted includes a number of revisions. The Commission is \\nmodifying: (1) The qualifications of a CCO to include a requirement \\nthat the CCO not serve as the general counsel of the SDR or be a member \\nof the SDR\\'s legal department; (2) the procedures relating to removing \\nthe CCO to require that an SDR notify the Commission when a CCO is \\nremoved; (3) the enumerated duties of the CCO to clarify that potential \\nconflicts of interest listed are not exhaustive and that the CCO is not \\nrequired to guarantee compliance with Commission regulations, but only \\nto take reasonable steps to ensure compliance; (4) the required \\ncontents of the annual compliance report that must be submitted to the \\nCommission to reflect that policies and procedures cannot guarantee \\ncompliance with Commission regulations; (5) the\\n\\n[[Page 54558]]\\n\\nprocedures relating to the submission of the annual compliance report \\nto the Commission to clarify that the report must be submitted with the \\nannual amendment to Form SDR and to remove certain provisions relating \\nto the process by which the Commission may disclose the report to other \\nparties; and (6) additional provisions as detailed below.\\n1. Definition of Board of Directors\\n    The Commission in proposed Sec.  49.22(a) defined the term ``board \\nof directors\\'\\' as ``the board of directors of a swap data repository or \\nfor those swap data repositories whose organizational structure does \\nnot include a board of directors, a body performing a function similar \\nto a board of directors.\\'\\' \\\\196\\\\ The Commission also requested comment \\non a number of issues, including whether: (1) There should be \\nadditional rules around the types of bodies which may perform board-\\nlike functions at an SDR; (2) the proposed definition of board of \\ndirectors appropriately address issues related to parent companies, \\nsubsidiaries, affiliates, and SDRs located in foreign jurisdictions; \\nand (3) the proposed rule allowed for sufficient flexibility with \\nregard to an SDR\\'s business structure.\\\\197\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\196\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80934.\\n    \\\\197\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80913.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received no comments on the proposed definition of \\nboard of directors.\\n    The Commission believes that the flexibility of the proposed \\ndefinition of board of directors adequately reflects the various forms \\nof business associations which an SDR could conceivably take, including \\nforms which do not include a corporate board of directors. Accordingly, \\nthe Commission is adopting Sec.  49.22(a) as proposed.\\n2. Designation and Qualifications of Chief Compliance Officer\\n    The Commission received three comments related to the designation \\nand qualifications of an SDR\\'s CCO, as described in proposed Sec.  \\n49.22(b)(1) and Sec.  49.22(b)(2), respectively. Two of these comments, \\nfrom Chris Barnard and Better Markets, relate to whether a CCO should \\nbe allowed to serve as general counsel of the SDR. The third comment, \\nfrom CME, discusses its concern regarding the CCO\\'s authority to \\n``enforce\\'\\' policies and procedures necessary to fulfill the duties set \\nforth for CCOs.\\\\198\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\198\\\\ CL-CME supra note 51 at 7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Better Markets and Chris Barnard commented that the CCO should not \\nbe allowed to serve as general counsel or be a member of the legal \\ndepartment of the SDR. Both commenters were concerned about the \\nconflicts of interest that would result from a CCO also representing \\nthe SDR in legal matters. In addition to its comment regarding CCO\\'s \\nserving as general counsel, Better Markets also commented that in \\nsituations where there are a number of affiliate organizations, ``a \\nsingle senior CCO should have overall responsibility of each affiliated \\nand controlled entity, even if individual entities within the group \\nhave CCOs.\\'\\' \\\\199\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\199\\\\ CL-Better Markets supra note 51 at 10.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.22(b)(1), pertaining to the designation of a CCO, \\nalso addresses the authority and resources available to a CCO. In \\nconnection, CME commented that the use of the word ``enforce\\'\\' in \\nproposed Sec.  49.22(b)(1)(i) gives the CCO authority that should be \\nreserved for senior management.\\n    The Commission agrees with the comments made by Better Markets and \\nChris Barnard regarding the inherent conflicts of interest that would \\noccur if a CCO were to serve as general counsel of an SDR or as an \\nattorney in the legal department. Any member of the legal department of \\nan SDR must act as an advocate for the SDR and pursue the SDR\\'s self-\\ninterest as narrowly defined by management. If a CCO were to serve as \\ngeneral counsel of the SDR or as a member of the legal department, this \\nrole as an advocate may diverge with the CCO\\'s statutory and regulatory \\nresponsibilities. The Commission believes that placing both sets of \\nobligations in a single individual creates potential conflicts of \\ninterest, and therefore, has determined to mitigate such potential \\nconflicts by prohibiting the CCO of an SDR from serving in the SDR\\'s \\nlegal department.\\\\200\\\\ As a result, the Commission is revising proposed \\nSec.  49.22(b)(2) to add Sec.  49.22(b)(2)(ii), which states that \\n``[t]he chief compliance officer may not be a member of the swap data \\nrepository\\'s legal department or serve as its general counsel.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\200\\\\ The Dodd-Frank Act also created the position of CCO for a \\nnumber of other regulated entities, including swap execution \\nfacilities. For these other regulated entities the Commission \\ndetermined that the conflicts of interest associated with a CCO \\nserving as in-house counsel were substantial and prohibited the CCO \\nfrom serving as in-house counsel for these regulated entities. See \\nproposed Sec.  37.1501(b)(2)(ii) and SEF NPRM supra note 111 at \\n1251.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In other respects, the Commission disagrees with commenters\\' views \\non the structure and conception of the CCO position. Section 21(e)(2) \\nof the CEA requires the CCO to ``resolve any conflicts of interest that \\nmay arise\\'\\' and ``ensure compliance with this Act.\\'\\' \\\\201\\\\ These duties \\nsuggest that the CCO is more than just an advisor to management and \\nwould have the ability to enforce compliance with the CEA and \\nCommission regulations. While the CEA does not specifically use the \\nword ``enforce,\\'\\' the Commission believes that this language is \\nnecessary to ensure that CCOs have the authority to fulfill their \\nstatutory and regulatory obligations and is consistent with the \\nstatutory directive for the CCO to ``ensure compliance with the Act \\n(including regulations).\\'\\' \\\\202\\\\ These considerations are particularly \\nimportant given an SDR CCO\\'s unique responsibilities with respect to \\nfair and open access requirements set forth in Sec.  49.27 and \\nprotecting commercially valuable swap data from improper use. The \\nCommission notes that the authority granted to the CCO pursuant to \\nSec.  49.22(b)(1)(i) does not include the ability to hire and fire SDR \\npersonnel other than its compliance staff. For purposes of \\nclarification, however, the Commission is adopting a minor modification \\nto Sec.  49.22(b)(1)(ii) to state that ``[t]he chief compliance officer \\nshall have supervisory authority over all staff acting at the direction \\nof the chief compliance officer.\\'\\' Section 49.22(b)(1)(ii) now provides \\ngreater clarity as to the SDR staff that must be under the managerial \\noversight of the CCO.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\201\\\\ Sections 21(e)(2)(C) and (E) of the CEA.\\n    \\\\202\\\\ Section 21(e)(2)(E) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that Sec.  49.22(b) effectively establishes \\nthe CCO as the focal point of regulatory compliance at an SDR and \\nensures that the CCO will have the authority to fulfill his or her \\nduties as set forth in the CEA and Commission regulations. Accordingly, \\nthe Commission is adopting Sec.  49.22(b)(1) and Sec.  49.22(b)(2) \\nsubject to the above modifications.\\n3. Appointment, Supervision and Removal of Chief Compliance Officer\\n    As set forth in the SDR NPRM, proposed Sec. Sec.  49.22(c)(1), \\n49.22(c)(2) and 49.22(c)(3) provide the supervisory regime applicable \\nto CCOs \\\\203\\\\ by requiring that a CCO be appointed by a majority of the \\nSDR\\'s board of directors or senior officer, and that a majority of the \\nboard or senior officer be responsible for approving the CCO\\'s \\ncompensation; by allowing an SDR with a board of directors to grant \\noversight authority to either its board or to its senior officer; and \\nby requiring the approval of a majority of an SDR\\'s board of directors \\nfor CCO removal (or in the\\n\\n[[Page 54559]]\\n\\ncase where a SDR has no board of directors, its senior officer).\\\\204\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\203\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80914.\\n    \\\\204\\\\ Id. at 80934.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  49.22(c)(1) and 49.22(c)(3) sought ``to provide \\nan SDR\\'s CCO with a measure of independence from management in the \\nperformance of his or her duties.\\'\\' \\\\205\\\\ However, the Commission \\nrequested comment regarding any additional measures that should be \\nrequired to adequately protect CCOs from undue influence. The \\nCommission was particularly interested in how it might offer such \\nprotection to a CCO who reports to his or her senior officer, either at \\nthe SDR\\'s choosing or because the SDR does not have a board of \\ndirectors.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\205\\\\ Id. at 80914.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission specifically requested comments on (1) whether a CCO \\nshould report to the SDR\\'s board rather than to its senior officer; (2) \\nwhat potential conflicts of interest might arise if a CCO reports to \\nthe senior officer rather than to the board, and how might those \\nconflicts be mitigated; and (3) whether ``senior officer\\'\\' of an SDR \\nshould be a defined term, and if so, how the term should be \\ndefined.\\\\206\\\\ In addition, the Commission also requested comment on \\nwhether the provision that would require a majority of a board of \\ndirectors to remove the CCO is sufficiently specific.\\\\207\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\206\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80914.\\n    \\\\207\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received four comments relating to the appointment, \\nsupervision and removal of a CCO. Three of these comments suggested \\nadditional measures to protect the CCO from excessive influence by \\nmanagement. The fourth commenter requested that, in the final rule, \\nSDRs be granted ``a reasonable amount of flexibility in determining how \\ncertain aspects of the CCO role (e.g., reporting lines, measures to \\nensure CCO independence) will be designed.\\'\\' \\\\208\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\208\\\\ See CL-CME supra note 51 at 7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Chris Barnard and Better Markets both recommended that the ability \\nto appoint or remove the CCO be granted to only the independent public \\ndirectors of the board and not of the entire board. Better Markets also \\ncommented that the CCO ``must have a direct reporting line to the \\nindependent directors or Audit Committee.\\'\\' \\\\209\\\\ Additionally, Better \\nMarkets stated that the CCO should be required to meet with the entire \\nboard of directors and the senior officer at least once a year and meet \\nwith the independent directors at least quarterly. Better Markets \\nbelieves that these quarterly meetings should be required to ensure \\nthat the independent members of the board can adequately supervise the \\nCCO. With regard to compensation, Better Markets commented that the \\nCCO\\'s compensation should be set by the independent members of the \\nboard and should not be the responsibility of the senior officer. Chris \\nBarnard also commented on compensation, stating that the compensation \\nof the CCO must be ``specifically designed in such a way that avoids \\npotential conflicts of interest with its compliance role.\\'\\' \\\\210\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\209\\\\ CL-Better Markets supra note 51 at 11.\\n    \\\\210\\\\ CL-Barnard supra note 51 at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Reval commented that a CCO should have ``a direct reporting line to \\nthe senior officer of the company,\\'\\' but should also report to a \\ncompliance or audit committee at the board level and have the ability \\nto take any compliance matters to this committee if the CCO does not \\nfeel the senior officer has properly addressed the issue.\\\\211\\\\ \\nAdditionally, in response to the Commission\\'s request for comment, \\nReval commented that it was not necessary for the Commission to define \\n``senior officer.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\211\\\\ CL-Reval supra note 51 at 10.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As stated above, the proposal, in connection with the oversight and \\nreporting structure of the CCO, was modeled on section 21(e)(2)(A) of \\nthe CEA, which requires a CCO to ``report directly to the board or to \\nthe senior officer of the swap data repository.\\'\\' \\\\212\\\\ However, the \\nCommission notes that Sec.  49.22(c) sets forth the minimum standards, \\nso that SDRs may implement additional measures if deemed necessary to \\ninsulate the CCO from influence. The Commission encourages SDRs to \\nreview and enact conflict mitigation procedures as appropriate for \\ntheir specific corporate and/or organizational structure.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\212\\\\ Section 21(e)(2)(A) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    While a majority of commenters expressed their concern that the \\nproposed rules do not sufficiently protect the independence of the CCO, \\nthe Commission believes that the package of protections offered in the \\nproposed rules are appropriately calibrated to insulate the CCO from \\nday-to-day commercial pressure. The proposed rules set forth detailed \\nappointment, supervisory and removal procedures that protect the CCO \\nfrom undue influence. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe it \\nis necessary to adopt commenters\\' recommendations. The Commission has \\nrevised proposed Sec.  49.22(c)(1) in one respect, however, by \\neliminating the requirement that a CCO\\'s appointment and compensation \\nrequire the approval of a majority of an SDR\\'s board of directors. The \\nCommission believes that board approval is a sufficient requirement, \\nand that SDRs should have appropriate discretion to determine the \\nvoting percentage necessary to appoint a CCO or determine their salary.\\n    However, to further protect the CCO, the Commission will clarify \\nand expand on the notification procedures regarding the appointment and \\nremoval of a CCO. Proposed Sec.  49.22(c)(3) required an SDR to notify \\nthe Commission within two business days of appointing any new CCO. \\nWhile this would effectively require an SDR to notify the Commission \\nwhenever a CCO is removed, the Commission believes that an explicit \\nrequirement is appropriate. Therefore, the Commission is adding the \\nfollowing sentence to Sec.  49.22(c)(3): ``The swap data repository \\nshall notify the Commission of such removal within two business days.\\'\\'\\n    The Commission believes that the appointment, supervisory and \\nremoval provisions of Sec.  49.22(c) will serve to effectively protect \\nthe CCO from undue influence and will ensure that the CCO will be \\nsufficiently shielded against retaliatory termination by the board or \\nthe senior officer of the SDR. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting \\nSec.  49.22(c)(2) as proposed and is adopting Sec. Sec.  49.22(c)(1) \\nand 49.22(c)(3) subject to the above modifications.\\n4. Duties of the Chief Compliance Officer\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.22(d) detailed the duties of a CCO and is based \\non the CCO duties set forth in section 21(e)(2) of the CEA. The \\nproposed rule listed the following as duties of the CCO: (1) Overseeing \\nand reviewing compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations; (2) \\nin consultation with the board of directors or the senior officer, \\nresolving any conflicts of interest that may arise; (3) establishing \\nand administering written policies and procedures designed to prevent \\nviolations of the CEA and Commission regulations; (4) ensuring \\ncompliance with the CEA and Commission regulations relating to \\nagreements, contracts, or transactions, and with commission regulations \\nunder section 21 of the CEA; (5) establishing procedures for the \\nremediation of noncompliance issues identified by the chief compliance \\nofficer; (6) establishing and following appropriate procedures for the \\nhandling, management response, remediation, retesting, and closing of \\nnoncompliance issues; and (7) establishing and administering a written \\ncode of ethics. In expanding on the CCO\\'s duty to resolve conflicts of\\n\\n[[Page 54560]]\\n\\ninterest, the proposed rule also listed a number of potential conflicts \\nthat may confront a CCO.\\\\213\\\\ This list of conflicts of interest was \\nintended to indicate ``the types of conflicts that the Commission \\nbelieves an SDR\\'s CCOs should be aware of, but [was] not exhaustive.\\'\\' \\n\\\\214\\\\ Additionally, to assist the CCO in meeting these \\nresponsibilities, proposed Sec.  49.22(b)(1), granted a CCO oversight \\nauthority over all compliance functions and staff acting in furtherance \\nof those compliance functions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\213\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80934.\\n    \\\\214\\\\ Id. at 80914.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the SDR NPRM, the Commission requested comment on any additional \\nCCO duties which the Commission should include, particularly addressing \\na CCO\\'s role in managing conflicts of interest within an SDR, the types \\nof conflicts which commenters believe might arise within an SDR, and \\nhow and by whom those conflicts should be resolved. The Commission also \\nrequested comment on whether the Commission should adopt a rule that \\nprohibits an officer, director or person employed by the SDR or related \\nperson to coerce, manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence the \\nCCO in performing his or her duties.\\\\215\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\215\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received four comments relating to the duties of an \\nSDR\\'s CCO.\\\\216\\\\ Three of the commenters--TriOptima, DTCC and CME--\\nexpressed concern that the enumerated duties of the CCO may cause the \\nCCO to infringe on traditionally management functions. CME also stated \\nthe Commission should not require the CCO to ``ensure\\'\\' compliance with \\nthe CEA and Commission regulations. Additionally, as summarized below, \\nBetter Markets and DTCC commented on the CCO\\'s duty to resolve any \\nconflicts of interest that may arise.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\216\\\\ See CL-TriOptima, CL-DTCC I, CL-CME and CL-Better Markets \\nsupra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    DTCC expressed its belief that the CCO should not be ``required to \\nbe responsible for the overall operation of the SDR\\'s business.\\'\\' \\\\217\\\\ \\nDTCC noted that while there are regulatory components in many areas, \\noversight of certain functions such as operational readiness and data \\nsecurity should not be the responsibility of the CCO, but should \\ninstead remain with senior management. TriOptima expressed similar \\nconcerns and stated its belief that the CCO\\'s duties should focus on \\nestablishing, monitoring and reporting on the SDR\\'s compliance \\npolicies. CME took issue with what it believes is an overly broad set \\nof responsibilities assigned to CCOs; it objects to, among other \\nprovisions, a CCO\\'s duty to ``resolve conflicts of interest.\\'\\' \\\\218\\\\ \\nWhile the CEA directs an SDR\\'s CCO to, among other things, ``resolve \\nany conflicts of interest that may arise,\\'\\' \\\\219\\\\ CME believes that the \\nword ``resolving\\'\\' in proposed Sec.  49.22(d)(2) gives the CCO \\nauthority that should be reserved for senior management.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\217\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 27.\\n    \\\\218\\\\ CL-CME supra note 51 at 7.\\n    \\\\219\\\\ Section 21(e)(2)(C) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    CME also commented on proposed Sec.  49.22(d)(4), which listed \\n``ensuring compliance with the Act and Commission regulations relating \\nto agreements, contracts, or transactions and with Commission \\nregulations under section 21 of the Act\\'\\' as one of the CCO\\'s \\nduties.\\\\220\\\\ CME believes that instead of requiring the CCO to \\n``ensure\\'\\' compliance, the rule should require the CCO to ``establish \\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance.\\'\\' \\n\\\\221\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\220\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80934.\\n    \\\\221\\\\ CL-CME supra note 51 at 4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    DTCC also requested that the Commission provide greater detail as \\nto which conflicts of interest the CCO is responsible for resolving. It \\nbelieves that ``the Commission should clarify that the CCO\\'s specific \\nresponsibilities related to conflicts are limited to compliance with \\nthe provisions of section 21 of the CEA and the final rules thereunder \\nas they relate to the swap operations of an SDR.\\'\\' \\\\222\\\\ DTCC also \\nsuggested a materiality threshold for conflicts that require the CCO to \\nconsult with the board of directors. Lastly, Better Markets requested \\nthat the CCO be required to consult with both the independent members \\nof the board of directors and the senior officer of the SDR when \\nresolving conflicts of interest.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\222\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 28.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission does not agree with those commenters that suggest \\nthat the proposed duties of the CCO improperly infringe on areas that \\nare traditionally management functions. Many of the commenters based \\ntheir objections on their view that the role of a CCO should be limited \\nto monitoring compliance and advising management on compliance issues. \\nThe Commission does not believe that this limited view is appropriate \\nfor the CCO of an SDR. In listing the duties of a CCO, section 21(e)(2) \\nof the CEA specifies that the CCO shall ``resolve any conflicts of \\ninterest that may arise\\'\\' and ``ensure compliance with this Act.\\'\\' \\n\\\\223\\\\ As stated above, successful execution of these duties will \\nrequire that a CCO have the ability to enforce compliance with the CEA \\nand Commission regulations. The Commission believes the language of the \\nCEA suggests that the CCO is more than just an advisor to management on \\ncompliance issues.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\223\\\\ Sections 21(e)(2)(C) and (E) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. \\n24a(e)(2)(C) and (E).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In that regard, the Commission understands that a single individual \\ncannot guarantee an SDR\\'s compliance with the CEA and Commission \\nregulations. However, an individual can take reasonable steps to ensure \\ncompliance. Accordingly, the Commission is revising Sec.  49.22(d)(4) \\nto state that one of the CCO\\'s duties shall include ``taking reasonable \\nsteps to ensure compliance with the Act and Commission regulations \\nrelating to agreements, contracts, or transactions, and with Commission \\nregulations under Section 21 of the Act, including confidentiality and \\nindemnification agreements entered into with foreign or domestic \\nregulators pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Act.\\'\\'\\n    The Commission also disagrees with DTCC\\'s comment that a CCO\\'s duty \\nto resolve conflicts of interest should be limited to those conflicts \\nthat relate to the swap operations of an SDR or that there be a \\nmateriality threshold for the CCO to consult with the board of the SDR. \\nThe Commission based this duty on the language of section 21(e)(2)(C) \\nof the CEA. This section does not limit the CCO\\'s duty to resolve \\nconflicts to only those that relate to the swap operations of an SDR, \\nnor does it suggest that there be a materiality threshold for \\nconsultation with the board of directors. Similarly, the Commission \\ndoes not agree with Better Market\\'s recommendation to add a requirement \\nthat the CCO consult with both the independent members of the board and \\nthe senior officer when resolving conflicts of interest. However, the \\nCommission notes that while section 21(e)(2)(C) of the CEA and Sec.  \\n49.22(d)(2) do not require SDRs to consult both the independent members \\nof the board and the senior officer when resolving conflicts of \\ninterest, the Commission would be supportive of any SDR that enacts \\nthis measure.\\n    In proposed Sec. Sec.  49.22(d)(2)(i)-(iii), the Commission \\nidentified a number of potential conflicts that may confront a \\nCCO.\\\\224\\\\ While the SDR NPRM expressly stated that this list of \\nconflicts ``is not exhaustive,\\'\\' the Commission believes that Sec.  \\n49.22(d)(2) should be modified to clarify this point.\\\\225\\\\ Therefore, \\nthe\\n\\n[[Page 54561]]\\n\\nCommission has revised proposed Sec.  49.22(d)(2) to add the word \\n``including\\'\\' before the list of potential conflicts of interest.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\224\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80934.\\n    \\\\225\\\\ See SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80914 which states: ``The \\nproposed Regulation also lists a number of potential conflicts that \\nmay confront a CCO. The list of conflicts of interest indicates the \\ntypes of conflicts that the Commission believes an SDR\\'s CCOs should \\nbe aware of, but it is not exhaustive.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes the revisions to Sec.  49.22(d) discussed \\nabove will provide greater clarity and effectiveness with respect to \\nthe duties of an SDR\\'s CCO. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting \\nSec.  49.22(d) largely as proposed, with the modifications detailed \\nabove for Sec.  49.22(d)(2), and Sec.  49.22(d)(4).\\n5. Preparation and Submission of Annual Compliance Report\\n    The Commission in proposed Sec.  49.22(e) detailed the information \\nthat must be included in the annual compliance report, including a \\ndescription of the SDR\\'s written policies and procedures, an assessment \\nby the CCO of the effectiveness of the SDR\\'s policies and procedures in \\nensuring compliance with section 21 of the CEA and a description of any \\nmaterial changes to the policies and procedures that were made to these \\nsince the last annual compliance report.\\\\226\\\\ In addition, proposed \\nSec.  49.22(e) also required the annual report to include a \\ncertification by the CCO that, under penalty of law, the compliance \\nreport is accurate and complete.\\\\227\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\226\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80934.\\n    \\\\227\\\\ Id. at 80934-80935.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.22(f)(1) set forth the procedures for review of \\nthe annual compliance report by the board of directors or senior \\nofficer of the SDR prior to submission to the Commission and proposed \\nSec.  49.22(f)(2) described the process for the submission of the \\nreport.\\\\228\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\228\\\\ See proposed Sec. Sec.  49.22(f)(1) and(2). Id. at 80935.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission requested comment with respect to whether the annual \\ncompliance report should contain additional content beyond what is \\nproposed in Sec.  49.22(e) and whether additional provisions are \\nnecessary to ensure that an SDR\\'s board of directors cannot adversely \\ninfluence the content of an annual compliance report as drafted by the \\nCCO.\\\\229\\\\ Alternatively, the Commission also requested comment on any \\nadditional provisions that might be necessary to ensure that individual \\ndirectors or other SDR employees have an adequate opportunity to \\nregister any concerns or objections they might have to the contents of \\nan annual compliance report. The Commission received three comments \\nregarding the preparation and submission of the annual compliance \\nreport. Both CME and DTCC commented primarily on the required \\nprovisions of the report, whereas Better Markets commented on the \\nprocedures for review by the board and submission to the Commission.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\229\\\\ Id. at 80915.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    CME suggested that the Commission require that the SDR\\'s senior \\nofficer, not its CCO, make the required certification under Sec.  \\n49.22(e)(7). DTCC expressed its belief that the report should be \\nlimited to detailing compliance with requirements of the CEA and the \\npolicies and procedures of the SDR that relate to its swap activities.\\n    Better Markets supported the requirement that the CCO present the \\nreport to the board of directors prior to its submission to the \\nCommission and proposed that the Board be required to approve the \\nreport in its entirety or detail where and why it disagrees with any \\nprovision. Better Markets also proposed that this approval or statement \\nof disagreement be submitted to the Commission along with the report. \\nDTCC also expressed its concern about public release of the reports and \\nstated its belief that the annual report should be kept confidential by \\nthe Commission and should not be available to the public or to market \\nparticipants.\\n    The Commission understands that compliance with the CEA and \\nCommission regulations cannot be guaranteed by an individual or by any \\npolicies or procedures and accordingly is revising proposed Sec.  \\n49.22(e)(2)(i) to require that the annual compliance report identify \\n``the policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance \\nwith each subsection and core principle, including each duty specified \\nin section 21(c).\\'\\' The Commission is also removing proposed Sec.  \\n49.22(e)(6). While some commenters were supportive of the provision, \\nthe Commission has determined that it is not necessary as a mandatory \\nrequirement. The annual compliance report is a product of the CCO and \\nintended to reflect his or her assessment of an SDR\\'s compliance. The \\nboard of directors may append its own comments if desired, but the \\nstatutory text and the Commission\\'s implementing regulations do not \\nrequire it.\\n    The Commission disagrees with CME\\'s comment regarding the \\ncertification requirement for the annual compliance report. While the \\nCEA does not explicitly require that the CCO certify the report, it \\ndoes require that the CCO ``annually prepare and sign\\'\\' and that the \\nreport ``include a certification that, under penalty of law, the \\ncompliance report is accurate and complete.\\'\\' \\\\230\\\\ The Commission \\nbelieves that these two requirements read together provide sufficient \\nbasis for the CCO to certify that the report is accurate and complete. \\nHowever, the Commission is modifying Sec.  49.22(e) to explicitly state \\nthat the CCO ``sign\\'\\' the annual compliance report in order to follow \\nthe statutory text more closely. The Commission also disagrees with \\nDTCC\\'s comment regarding limiting the scope of the report. There is no \\nindication in the CEA that the report should be limited to only the \\nswap activities of the SDR and the Commission believes there is no \\nreason for the report to be limited in such a manner.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\230\\\\ Section 21(e)(3) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission also disagrees with Better Market\\'s suggestion to \\nrequire the board to approve the report in its entirety or submit a \\nstatement detailing its objection. The Commission believes that \\nrequiring the board to approve the report would increase the risk that \\nthe CCO would be subject to undue influence by the board or by \\nmanagement. The proposed rule, as modified above, strikes the \\nappropriate balance between ensuring that the board cannot adversely \\ninfluence the content of a report and giving the board the opportunity \\nto express their opinion of the report to the Commission. Additionally, \\nthe Commission acknowledges DTCC\\'s concerns regarding public release of \\nthe report but believes that part 145 of Commission regulations \\nsufficiently ensures that the annual compliance report will remain \\nconfidential. The Commission also does not believe Sec.  49.22(f)(5) is \\nnecessary to protect the report from unnecessary release to the public \\nor market participants. Therefore, the Commission has modified Sec.  \\n49.22(f) to remove Sec.  49.22(f)(5).\\n    Section 21(e)(3)(B)(i) of the CEA requires that an annual \\ncompliance report ``accompany each appropriate financial report of the \\nswap data repository that is required to be furnished to the Commission \\npursuant to this section.\\'\\' \\\\231\\\\ Under the proposed rules, since an \\nSDR\\'s year-end financial information must be submitted as an exhibit to \\nForm SDR, the annual compliance report was required to accompany this \\nannual amendment to Form SDR.\\\\232\\\\ Because this language was missing \\nfrom proposed Sec.  49.22(f)(2), the Commission has revised Sec.  \\n49.22(f)(2) to state that ``The annual compliance report shall be \\nprovided electronically\\n\\n[[Page 54562]]\\n\\nto the Commission not more than 60 days after the end of the registered \\nswap data repository\\'s fiscal year, concurrently with the filing of the \\nannual amendment to Form SDR that must be submitted to the Commission \\npursuant to Sec.  49.3(a)(5) of this part.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\231\\\\ Section 21(e)(3)(B)(i) of the CEA.\\n    \\\\232\\\\ See Exhibits M and N of proposed Form SDR set forth in the \\nSDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80943.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that Sec. Sec.  49.22(e) and (f) \\nsuccessfully establish requirements to ensure that the annual \\ncompliance report accomplishes the regulatory goal of providing the \\nCommission with a complete and accurate picture of an SDR\\'s regulatory \\ncompliance program. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec. Sec.  \\n49.22(e) and (f) as proposed, with the exception that Sec. Sec.  \\n49.22(e), 49.22(e)(2)(i), 49.22(e)(6), 49.22(f)(2), and 49.22(f)(5) are \\nrevised as detailed above.\\n6. Recordkeeping\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.22(g) detailed recordkeeping requirements for \\nrecords relating to a CCO\\'s areas of responsibility. This proposed \\nregulation required an SDR to maintain: (1) A copy of its written \\npolicies and procedures, including its code of ethics and conflicts of \\ninterest policies; (2) copies of all materials, including written \\nreports provided to the board of directors in connection with review of \\nthe annual report, as well as the board minutes or other similar \\nwritten records, that record the submission of the annual compliance \\nreport to an SDR\\'s board of directors or its senior officer; and (3) \\nany records relevant to an SDR\\'s annual report. The proposed rule \\nrequired SDRs to maintain these records in accordance with Sec.  1.31 \\nof the Commission\\'s regulations.\\n    The Commission received one comment regarding the compliance \\nrecordkeeping provisions in proposed Sec.  49.22(g) from Chris Barnard, \\nwho recommended that compliance records be kept indefinitely.\\n    As stated in the SDR NPRM, the Commission designed Sec.  49.22(g) \\nto ensure that Commission staff would be able to obtain the information \\nnecessary to determine whether an SDR has complied with the CEA and \\napplicable regulations.\\\\233\\\\ The Commission believes that proposed \\nSec.  49.22(g) successfully accomplishes this goal in accordance with \\nexisting Commission regulation Sec.  1.31 which requires that regulated \\nentities maintain records for five years. Accordingly, the Commission \\nis adopting Sec.  49.22(g) as proposed.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\233\\\\ Id. at 80915.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nD. Core Principles Applicable to SDRs--Sec.  49.19\\n\\n    Proposed Sec. Sec.  49.19-49.21 implement the three substantive \\ncore principles prescribed by section 21(f) of the CEA for registered \\nSDRs.\\\\234\\\\ The Commission is largely adopting the core principles as \\nproposed. Each core principle is discussed in turn below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\234\\\\ Section 21(f)(4), 7 U.S.C. 24a(f)(4), establishes as a \\nfourth core principle Commission authority to establish additional \\nrules for registered SDRs. The Commission proposed and is today \\nadopting Sec. Sec.  49.25-49.27 pursuant to this authority. These \\nrules are discussed in section E, below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Antitrust Considerations (Core Principle 1)\\n    Core Principle 1 directs SDRs to consider competition issues in \\nconnection with its rules and/or activities.\\\\235\\\\ The Commission is \\nadopting as proposed Sec.  49.19 (Core Principle 1),\\\\236\\\\ which \\nprovides that unless appropriate to achieve the purposes of the CEA, a \\nregistered SDR shall avoid adopting any rule or taking any action that \\nresults in any unreasonable restraint of trade, or imposing any \\nmaterial anticompetitive burden on trading, clearing or reporting \\nswaps. Like all core principles, Sec.  49.19 directly incorporates \\nstatutory language, and the absence of particular guidance or safe \\nharbors at this time does not diminish an SDR\\'s obligation to comply \\nwith the core principle itself.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\235\\\\ The Commission itself is required to consider the \\nantitrust laws in fulfilling its statutory obligations. Section \\n15(b) of the CEA provides that the Commission shall take into \\nconsideration the public interest to be protected by the \\nantitrustlaws and endeavor to take the least anticompetitive means \\nof achieving the objective of this chapter, as well as the policies \\nand purposes of this chapter, in issuing any order or adopting any \\nCommission rule or regulation * * * or in requiring or approving any \\nbylaw, rule or regulation of a contract market or registered futures \\nassociation * * *\\n    \\\\236\\\\ The Commission received no comments in connection with \\nproposed Sec.  49.19.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Governance Arrangements (Core Principle 2) and Conflicts of Interest \\n(Core Principle 3)\\n    Section 21(f)(2) of the CEA, Core Principle 2, requires that each \\nSDR establish governance arrangements that are transparent to fulfill \\npublic interest requirements and to support the objectives of the \\nFederal Government, owners, and participants. Section 21(f)(3) of the \\nCEA, Core Principle 3, provides that each SDR must establish and \\nenforce rules to minimize conflicts of interest in the decision-making \\nprocess of the SDR and to establish a process for resolving such \\nconflicts. In the SDR NPRM, the Commission proposed regulations \\nregarding (i) the transparency of SDR governance arrangements (Proposed \\nSec.  49.20) and (ii) SDR identification and mitigation of existing and \\npotential conflicts of interest (Proposed Sec.  49.21), in order to \\nimplement Core Principles 2 and 3, respectively.\\n    The Commission received ten comments from interested parties.\\\\237\\\\ \\nAs discussed below, the Commission is adopting Sec.  49.20 and Sec.  \\n49.21 substantially as proposed, subject to the revisions described \\nbelow.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\237\\\\ See CL-AFR, CL-CME, CL-Council, CL-DTCC I, CL-DTCC II, CL-\\nReval II, CL-TriOptima, CL-Better Markets, CL-ABC/CIEBA and CL-\\nBarnard supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Governance Arrangements (Core Principle 2)--Sec.  49.20\\n(a) Transparency of Governance Arrangements\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.20(a) required each registered SDR to establish \\ngovernance arrangements that are well-defined and include a clear \\norganizational structure with consistent lines of responsibility and \\neffective internal controls.\\\\238\\\\ In addition, proposed Sec.  49.20(b) \\nmandated certain minimum standards for the transparency of SDR \\ngovernance arrangements. These minimum standards required an SDR to: \\n(1) Include a statement in its charter documents regarding the \\ntransparency of its governance arrangements, and the manner in which \\nsuch transparency supports the objectives of the Federal Government; \\n(2) make available certain information to the public and relevant \\nauthorities;\\\\239\\\\ (3) ensure that the information made available is \\ncurrent, accurate, clear and readily accessible; and (4) disclose \\nsummaries of significant decisions in a sufficiently comprehensive and \\ndetailed fashion so that the public and relevant authorities would have \\nthe ability to discern the SDR policies or procedures implicated and \\nthe manner in which SDR decisions\\n\\n[[Page 54563]]\\n\\nimplement or amend such policies or procedures.\\\\240\\\\ Proposed Sec.  \\n49.20(b) would not require SDRs to publicly disclose minutes of board \\nof directors or committee meetings, however, disclosure to the \\nCommission would be required upon request.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\238\\\\ See SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80932-80933.\\n    \\\\239\\\\ Such information includes: (i) The registered SDR mission \\nstatement; (ii) the mission statement and/or charter of the \\nregistered SDR Board of Directors and certain committees; (iii) the \\nboard of directors nominations process of the registered SDR, as \\nwell as the process for assigning members of the board of directors \\nor other persons to certain committees; (iv) names of all members of \\n(a) the board of directors and (b) certain committees; (v) a \\ndescription of how the board of directors and certain committees \\nconsider an independent perspective in their decision-making \\nprocesses; (vi) the lines of responsibility and accountability for \\neach operational unit of the registered SDR; and (vii) summaries of \\nsignificant decisions implicating the public interest, the rationale \\nfor such decisions, and the process for reaching such decisions. \\nThese significant decisions include decisions relating to pricing of \\nrepository services, the offering of ancillary services, access to \\ndata, and the use of SDR Information. SDR NPRM supra note 8 at \\n80916.\\n    \\\\240\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80933 n.116.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received no comments addressing proposed Sec.  \\n49.20(a), but received two comment letters related to proposed Sec.  \\n49.20(b). One comment, from the Council, discussed the need for greater \\ntransparency in certain areas including SDR director independence. \\nTriOptima\\'s comment related to the public disclosure of summaries of \\nsignificant decisions implicating the public interest.\\n    The Council commented that the Commission\\'s proposal relating to \\nthe public disclosure of an SDR\\'s mission statement, board nomination \\nprocess and board committee assignment process is consistent with the \\nCouncil\\'s best practices for corporate boards.\\\\241\\\\ However, the \\nCouncil requested that the Commission consider whether there should be \\ngreater transparency with respect to: (1) Director independence; (2) \\nthe board\\'s role in risk oversight; and (3) director compensation in \\nthe final rule.\\\\242\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\241\\\\ CL-Council supra note 51 at 1.\\n    \\\\242\\\\ Id. at 2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    TriOptima expressed its concern regarding proposed Sec.  \\n49.20(b)(vii), which required each registered SDR to make available to \\nthe public and relevant authorities, including the Commission, \\nsummaries of significant decisions implicating the public \\ninterest.\\\\243\\\\ As an alternative to public disclosure, TriOptima \\nproposed that the Commission require SDRs to make ongoing reports to \\nthe Commission regarding board of directors and committee decisions \\nthat affect SDR compliance with the applicable regulations, \\nparticularly changes to its procedures and compliance status.\\\\244\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\243\\\\ CL-TriOptima supra note 51 at 5.\\n    \\\\244\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission has considered the Council\\'s comments regarding the \\nneed for greater transparency with respect to: (1) Director \\nindependence; (2) the board\\'s role in risk oversight and (3) director \\ncompensation, and has concluded that the proposed minimum transparency \\nrequirements are sufficient to support the objectives of the Federal \\nGovernment and fulfill the public interest. With respect to TriOptima\\'s \\nproposed alternative regarding the public disclosure of significant \\ndecisions, the Commission declines to adopt TriOptima\\'s recommendation \\nto report only SDR board of directors or committee decisions that would \\naffect the SDR\\'s compliance with the Commission\\'s regulations and to \\nlimit such reporting to the Commission solely. Since an SDR is required \\nto have governance arrangements that are transparent to fulfill the \\npublic interest,\\\\245\\\\ the Commission believes that the public should be \\nfully informed of the manner in which an SDR satisfies such \\nrequirement. The Commission emphasizes, however, that SDRs should not \\nbe required to disclose Section 8 Material (as defined in Sec.  \\n49.2(a)(14)) or, where appropriate, information that the SDR may have \\nreceived on a confidential basis from a reporting entity. Accordingly, \\nthe Commission has adopted Sec.  49.20(a) as proposed and has revised \\nSec.  49.20(b) to exclude the disclosure of Section 8 Material and, \\nwhere appropriate, information received by an SDR from a reporting \\nentity on a confidential basis.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\245\\\\ Section 21(f)(2) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 24a(f)(2).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(b) Consideration of an Independent Perspective\\n    In proposed Sec.  49.20(c)(1)(i)(A), the Commission required that \\neach registered SDR establish, maintain, and enforce policies and \\nprocedures to ensure that (i) its board of directors, as well as (ii) \\nany SDR committee that has the authority to (A) act on behalf of the \\nboard of directors or (B) amend or constrain the action thereof, \\nadequately considers a perspective independent of competitive, \\ncommercial, or industry interests in its deliberations.\\\\246\\\\ As \\ndiscussed in the SDR NPRM, ``the Commission believes that the board of \\ndirectors, as well as each abovementioned committee, would be more \\nlikely to contemplate the manner in which a decision might affect all \\nconstituencies, and less likely to concentrate on the manner in which a \\ndecision affects the interests of the control group, if it integrates \\nan independent perspective in its deliberations.\\'\\' \\\\247\\\\ Therefore, in \\ncounterbalancing the perspective of certain reporting entities \\ncontrolling an SDR, the Commission believes that the integration of an \\nindependent perspective would aid in addressing the conflicts of \\ninterest identified in the SDR NPRM. The Commission also proposed that \\nthe independent perspective be reflected in the nominations process for \\nthe board of directors, as well as the process for assigning members of \\nthe board of directors or other persons to the abovementioned class of \\ncommittees. Thus, proposed Sec.  49.20(c)(1)(i)(B) also required each \\nregistered SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and \\nprocedures to ensure that such nominations and assignment processes \\nadequately incorporate an independent perspective. In addition to the \\nindependent perspective requirement, the Commission proposed to promote \\nthe transparency of governance arrangements through proposed Sec.  \\n49.20(c)(1)(ii), which required that a registered SDR meet certain \\nreporting requirements relating to its board of directors, as well as \\neach SDR committee of the type mentioned above.\\\\248\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\246\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80917 (discussing the importance \\nof the independent perspective in mitigating conflicts of interest).\\n    \\\\247\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\248\\\\ Specifically, the Commission proposed to require an SDR to \\nsubmit the following within thirty (30) days after an election of \\nthe board of directors: (i) For the board of directors, as well as \\neach such committee, a list of all members; (ii) a description of \\nthe relationship, if any, between such members and the SDR or its \\naffiliates; and (iii) any amendments to the policies and procedures \\nthat the SDR maintains with respect to consideration of the \\nindependent perspective. See SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80933.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received no comments regarding the reporting \\nrequirements in Sec.  49.20(c)(1)(ii) and has adopted this regulation \\nas proposed. The Commission received three comment letters regarding \\nits proposed independent perspective requirement.\\\\249\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\249\\\\ See CL-DTCC II, CL-Barnard and CL-Reval II supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    DTCC recommended that SDR conflicts of interest be mitigated \\nthrough the imposition of structural governance requirements designed \\nto ensure an independent perspective on the board of directors and \\ncommittees, as well as broad representation from all classes of market \\nparticipants.\\\\250\\\\ In addition, DTCC indicated that an SDR should have \\ngovernance that is independent from its affiliates and that such \\nindependence and the broad representation of market participants would \\nsupport the Commission\\'s open access provisions.\\\\251\\\\ Barnard suggested \\nthat the Commission require an SDR to have independent public directors \\non their boards of directors and any committee that has authority to \\nact on behalf of the board directors or amend or constrain the action \\nof the board of directors.\\\\252\\\\ Reval recommended that the Commission \\nprohibit a representative of a reporting entity from sitting on a board \\ncommittee that\\n\\n[[Page 54564]]\\n\\nnominates public directors or governs compliance, or on any other \\nrelevant committee.\\\\253\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\250\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 16.\\n    \\\\251\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\252\\\\ CL-Barnard supra note 51 at 3.\\n    \\\\253\\\\ CL-Reval supra note 51 at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission agrees with DTCC regarding the importance of open \\naccess, and notes that proposed Sec. Sec.  49.20 and 49.21 complement \\nthe proposed SDR open access requirements set forth in Sec.  49.27. The \\nCommission notes that an SDR could choose to have governance that is \\nindependent from affiliates, as one of a number of complementary \\nmethods to ensure the consideration of an independent perspective. \\nHowever, the Commission declines to include a ``fair representation\\'\\' \\nrequirement as DTCC recommends. Section 21(f)(2) of the CEA requires an \\nSDR to establish governance arrangements that are transparent (i) to \\nfulfill public interest requirements; and (ii) to support the \\nobjectives of the Federal Government, owners, and participants. The \\nCommission observes that even if an SDR is governed by a broad cross-\\nsection of market participants, such governance may not serve the \\npublic interest. For example, if an SDR is governed by three \\nconstituencies with equal voice and two are conflicted (but in the same \\ndirection), the decision of such conflicted constituencies would stand.\\n    With respect to requiring an SDR to include public directors on its \\nboard of directors and any committee that has authority to act on \\nbehalf of the board directors or amend or constrain the action of the \\nboard of directors, the Commission declines to mandate the method in \\nwhich an SDR incorporates the consideration of an independent \\nperspective on its board of directors or committees. As discussed \\nbelow, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to afford SDRs \\nmore flexibility in determining their ownership, and governance, \\nstructures. The Commission notes that an SDR\\'s implementation of the \\n``public director\\'\\' concept (e.g., as explicitly set forth for DCOs, \\nDCMs and SEFs) would be one method of meeting the requirement to \\nconsider an independent perspective with a greater degree of certainty.\\n    The Commission also declines to adopt Reval\\'s recommendation with \\nrespect to the board and committee nominations processes. The \\nCommission believes that the inclusion of an independent perspective in \\nthe board nominations process, as well as on board committees that \\ngovern compliance (or other relevant committees), is sufficient to \\ncounterbalance the perspective of reporting entities that sit on such \\nbodies, especially given the Commission\\'s preference to afford SDRs \\nflexibility. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting the ``independent \\nperspective\\'\\' requirement in Sec.  49.20(c)(1) as proposed.\\n(c) Structural Governance Requirements and Limitations on Ownership of \\nVoting Equity and the Exercise of Voting Rights\\n    Although the Commission did not propose specific structural \\ngovernance requirements relating to the composition of the Board of \\nDirectors and the establishment of board committees for SDRs or \\nlimitations on ownership of SDR voting equity and the exercise of \\nvoting rights, the Commission requested comment on the imposition of \\nsuch requirements and limitations in the SDR NPRM.\\\\254\\\\ Six commenters \\n\\\\255\\\\ addressed the necessity of such requirements for SDRs, and two \\ncommenters \\\\256\\\\ discussed the effect of such requirements on \\ncompetition.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\254\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80917.\\n    \\\\255\\\\ See CL-AFR, CL-Barnard, CL-Better Markets, CL-DTCC I, CL-\\nReval and CL-TriOptima supra note 51.\\n    \\\\256\\\\ See CL-Reval and CL-TriOptima supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    AFR, Barnard and Better Markets \\\\257\\\\ suggested that, at a minimum, \\nthe SDR governance regulations should contain the same board \\ncomposition requirements and ownership and voting limitations that the \\nCommission proposed for DCOs, DCMs, and SEFs in the Conflicts of \\nInterest Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.\\\\258\\\\ AFR submitted that ``the \\ninformation controlled by SDRs can create conflicts that are \\npotentially as great as many of the conflicts that could exist for \\nother derivatives infrastructure organizations\\'\\' such as DCOs, DCMs, \\nand SEFs,\\\\259\\\\ while Better Markets submitted that the potential \\nconflicts of interest for an SDR stem from the SDR being dominated by \\nor subject to the direct or indirect influence of their major \\ncustomers--large financial institutions which generate the data that an \\nSDR collects, manages and distributes.\\\\260\\\\ For these reasons, both AFR \\nand Better Markets believe that SDR governance regulations should \\nparallel the governance rules of a DCO, DCM and SEF.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\257\\\\ CL-AFR supra note 51 at 2; CL-Barnard, supra note 51 at 3 \\n(stating that there should be a level playing field between SDRs and \\nDCOs with respect to board membership requirements and ownership and \\nvoting limits); and CL-Better Markets supra note 51 at 10.\\n    \\\\258\\\\ Commission, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Requirements \\nFor Derivatives Clearing Organizations, Designated Contract Markets, \\nAnd Swap Execution Facilities Regarding The Mitigation Of Conflicts \\nOf Interest, 75 FR 63732 (Oct. 18, 2010) (``Conflicts of Interest \\nNPRM\\'\\'). In the Conflicts of Interest NPRM, the Commission proposed \\nrules to mitigate potential conflicts of interest in the operation \\nof a DCO, DCM, and SEF through (i) structural governance \\nrequirements and (ii) limits on the ownership of voting equity and \\nthe exercise of voting power. The proposed structural governance \\nrequirements include composition requirements for DCO, DCM, or SEF \\nBoards of Directors. Specifically, such boards must be composed of \\nat least 35 percent, but no less than two, public directors. With \\nrespect to limits on ownership of voting equity and the exercise of \\nvoting power, the proposed rules limit DCM or SEF members (and \\nrelated persons) from beneficially owning more than twenty (20) \\npercent of any class of voting equity in the registered entity or \\nfrom directly or indirectly voting an interest exceeding twenty (20) \\npercent of the voting power of any class of equity interest in the \\nregistered entity. With respect to a DCO only, the proposed rules \\nrequire a DCO to choose one of two alternative limits on the \\nownership of voting equity or the exercise of voting power. Under \\nthe first alternative, no individual member may beneficially own \\nmore than twenty (20) percent of any class of voting equity in the \\nDCO or directly or indirectly vote an interest exceeding twenty (20) \\npercent of the voting power of any class of equity interest in the \\nDCO. In addition, the enumerated entities, whether or not they are \\nDCO members, may not collectively own on a beneficial basis more \\nthan forty (40) percent of any class of voting equity in a DCO, or \\ndirectly or indirectly vote an interest exceeding forty (40) percent \\nof the voting power of any class of equity interest in the DCO. \\nUnder the second alternative, no DCO member or enumerated entity, \\nregardless of whether it is a DCO member, may own more than five (5) \\npercent of any class of voting equity in the DCO or directly or \\nindirectly vote an interest exceeding five (5) percent of the voting \\npower of any class of equity interest in the DCO. The proposed rules \\nalso provide a procedure for the DCO to apply for, and the \\nCommission to grant, a waiver of the limits specified in the first \\nand second alternative.\\n    \\\\259\\\\ CL-AFR supra note 51 at 2.\\n    \\\\260\\\\ CL-Better Markets supra note 51 at 9-10.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Only one commenter stated that ownership and voting limitations \\nshould not be considered for SDRs.\\\\261\\\\ DTCC indicated that the \\nimposition of such limitations ``would be an imprecise tool with which \\nto achieve the policy goals of the Commission regarding conflicts of \\ninterest.\\'\\' \\\\262\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\261\\\\ See CL-DTCC I and CL-DTCC II supra note 51 at 16 and 2, \\nrespectively.\\n    \\\\262\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Reval and TriOptima expressed the concern that, as proposed, \\nSec. Sec.  49.20 and 49.21 would create an ``uncompetitive \\nenvironment\\'\\' by deterring independent service providers from \\nregistering as SDRs.\\\\263\\\\ Both Reval and TriOptima recommended that the \\nCommission impose certain structural governance requirements and/or \\nownership and voting limitations to market participants that own or \\ncontrol an SDR to mitigate such an anticompetitive effect. \\nSpecifically, Reval recommended that the Commission require that (i) no \\nfinancial entity, swap dealer, or major swap participant be allowed to \\nbecome an SDR, (ii) no SDR permit its equity or\\n\\n[[Page 54565]]\\n\\ndebt to be held by any market participant that, together with its \\nrelated persons, would have more than 5 percent of the notional \\nprincipal swap volume in the asset class for which the SDR is \\nregistering, and (iii) no SDR permit any market participant to hold \\nmore than 5 percent of its equity (or alternatively, 20 percent, if the \\nCommission believes that 5 percent is too low a threshold).\\\\264\\\\ \\nTriOptima recommended that potential conflicts of interest and \\ncompliance with the applicable Core Principles be addressed by more \\ntailored rules that distinguish between ``Independent SDRs\\'\\' and ``Tied \\nSDRs,\\'\\' which are actually or presumptively, controlled by swap market \\nparticipants.\\\\265\\\\ Therefore, TriOptima suggested that the Commission \\nadopt a two-tiered approach to mitigating SDR conflicts of \\ninterest.\\\\266\\\\ Under this approach, ``Tied SDRs\\'\\' would be subject to \\nthe full panoply of conflicts of interest and governance requirements, \\nincluding (i) restrictions on ownership and voting rights, (ii) \\nprovisions for board nominations procedures and public directors, and \\n(iii) requirements for policies and procedures to ensure that board \\nmembers and certain committees do not favor the interests of a control \\ngroup. In contrast, ``Independent SDRs\\'\\' would be subject only to \\nrequirements that concentrate on procedures, reporting and examination, \\nwhich would ensure that changes in the SDR\\'s business, governance \\nstructure or organization do not adversely affect impartiality.\\\\267\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\263\\\\ CL-Reval supra note 51 at 5 and CL-TriOptima supra note 51 \\nat 4.\\n    \\\\264\\\\ CL-Reval supra note 51 at 4. Reval suggested that bank-\\nrelated trade repositories be permitted to be a third-party \\nreporting entity that can, on behalf of its owners, report to a \\nregistered SDR.\\n    \\\\265\\\\ CL-TriOptima supra note 51 at 4. TriOptima defines a Tied \\nSDR as an SDR with voting stock that is more than 50 percent owned \\nor controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more market \\nparticipants, or where a majority of its board was nominated or \\nappointed, directly or indirectly, by one or more market \\nparticipants, or where the Commission has determined, after \\nexamination and review, that an SDR is under effective control of \\none or more market participants. TriOptima defines an Independent \\nSDR as one that meets none of the above criteria.\\n    \\\\266\\\\ CL-TriOptima supra note 51 at 4.\\n    \\\\267\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In determining the appropriate regulatory approach for the \\ngovernance and the mitigation of potential conflicts of interest in the \\noperation of DCOs, DCMs, SEFs and SDRs, the Commission examined the \\nways in which such entities exercised discretion in performing their \\nrespective functions. The Commission notes that the discretion \\nexercised by a DCO, DCM or SEF with respect to their ability to \\ninfluence participation on the entity (e.g., execution, clearing \\nmembership, portfolio compression) or the acceptance of all trades in \\nan asset class differs significantly from that of an SDR. The \\nCommission agrees with DTCC that an SDR lacks discretion similar to \\nthat exercised by DCOs, DCMs and SEFs in its collection and maintenance \\nof data related to swap transactions in that ``the SDR is not defining \\nthe reporting party, timeliness, or content for public dissemination, \\nand similarly the SDR is not defining the reporting party, content, or \\nprocess for regulatory access. The SDR does not have significant \\ninfluence over the inclusion or omission of information in the \\nreporting process, nor does it control the output of the process.\\'\\' \\n\\\\268\\\\ Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to \\nafford SDRs more flexibility in determining their ownership and \\ngovernance structures, in contrast to DCOs, DCMs and SEFs and declines \\nto impose additional structural governance requirements and ownership \\nand voting limitations on SDRs. However, the Commission may in the \\nfuture re-examine SDR governance requirements based on changing \\nconditions and/or market developments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\268\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 16.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission has also considered and rejected Reval and \\nTriOptima\\'s recommendations to impose limitations on SDR ownership and \\nvoting equity as well as separate regulatory schemes for independent \\nand tied/market participant owned or controlled SDRs. Preliminarily, \\nthe Commission notes that the Dodd-Frank Act neither endorses nor \\ndiscourages a particular SDR market structure (e.g., the ``public \\nutility\\'\\' or the ``for-profit\\'\\' model); from a policy perspective, so \\nlong as an entity complies with the CEA and the regulations thereunder, \\nthe Commission has no preference whether the entity is an ``Independent \\nSDR,\\'\\' a ``Tied SDR,\\'\\' or a market-participant owned or controlled SDR. \\nThe Commission acknowledges that control of an SDR by one or more \\nreporting entities may lead to conflicts of interest; however, the \\nCommission notes that ownership is only one form of control. The \\nCommission believes that the substantive requirements (e.g., \\ntransparency of governance arrangements, consideration of an \\nindependent perspective, policies and procedures on conflicts of \\ninterest) proposed in part 49 appropriately mitigate SDR conflicts of \\ninterest, especially in conjunction with (i) non-discrimination \\nrequirements regarding access and fees; and (ii) limitations on \\ndisclosure and use of non-public information. Moreover, the Commission \\nnotes that these substantive requirements are the minimum requirements \\nnecessary to ensure the adequacy of governance arrangements and the \\namelioration of conflicts of interest, for an ``Independent SDR,\\'\\' a \\n``Tied SDR,\\'\\' or a market-participant owned or controlled SDR.\\n    (d) Substantive Requirements for SDR Boards of Directors (and \\nCertain SDR Committees)\\n    The Commission proposed a number of substantive requirements for \\nSDR boards of directors and certain SDR committees to mitigate existing \\nand potential conflicts of interest. Proposed Sec.  49.20(c)(5) \\nrequired that the SDR board of directors, SDR senior management, and \\nmembers of any SDR committee that has the authority to (i) act on \\nbehalf of the board of directors; or (ii) amend or constrain the \\nactions thereof, in each case, have the following attributes: (a) \\nSufficiently good reputations; (b) the requisite skills and expertise \\nto fulfill their responsibilities in the management and governance of \\nthe registered SDR; (c) a clear understanding of such responsibilities; \\nand (d) the ability to exercise sound judgment about SDR affairs.\\n    In addition to the expertise requirement, the Commission proposed \\nother substantive requirements in Sec.  49.20(c) to enhance the \\naccountability of SDR boards of directors to the Commission.\\n    The Commission received one comment regarding the substantive \\nrequirements for SDR boards of directors and certain committees. DTCC \\naddressed the expertise requirement in proposed Sec.  49.20(c)(5). DTCC \\nrecognized the value of requiring that an SDR board incorporate an \\nindependent perspective, but questioned whether potential directors \\nthat do not directly participate in the markets would have \\n``sufficient, timely, and comprehensive expertise on issues critical to \\nthe extraordinarily complex financial operations of an SDR.\\'\\' \\\\269\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\269\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 16-17.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Since the operations of an SDR are not specialized in the same \\nmanner as, for example, a DCO, the Commission questions whether the \\n``comprehensive\\'\\' expertise referenced by DTCC is necessary. The \\nCommission is not persuaded that it will be difficult to find directors \\nthat can (i) bring an independent perspective; and (ii) sufficient, \\ntimely and comprehensive expertise. In addition, the Commission is not \\nconvinced that directors with an independent perspective would lack \\nincentive to acquire any necessary\\n\\n[[Page 54566]]\\n\\nexpertise (especially because such directors may be removed). \\nAccordingly, the Commission is adopting Sec.  49.20(c)(5) as proposed.\\n    The Commission received no comments on the proposed substantive \\nrequirements mandated by Sec.  49.20(c)(1)(i)(C) and Sec.  49.20(c)(2)-\\n(4) and is adopting these regulations as proposed.\\n4. Conflicts of Interest (Core Principle 3)--Sec.  49.21\\n    In the SDR NPRM, the Commission discussed the conflicts of interest \\nthat a registered SDR may confront in its operations.\\\\270\\\\ As the \\nCommission noted, such conflicts may involve (i) discrimination against \\ncertain reporting entities in SDR access, pricing, and provision of \\nservices; and (ii) unfair or anticompetitive disclosure or use of SDR \\nInformation.\\\\271\\\\ The Commission noted that such conflicts of interest \\nmay originate in the control of an SDR by one reporting entity or a \\nsmall subset of reporting entities (a ``control group\\'\\'). Such control \\nmay result from representation on SDR governing bodies, whether through \\n(i) ownership of voting equity or the exercise of voting rights; or \\n(ii) other direct or indirect means. As the Commission stated, a \\ncontrol group may compete with other reporting entities in the \\nexecution or clearing of swap transactions and may have an incentive to \\nleverage its influence over the registered SDR to gain a competitive \\nadvantage in relation to other reporting entities.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\270\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80918-80919.\\n    \\\\271\\\\ Id. at 80916 n.106. In addition, the Commission stated \\nthat ``the existence of such conflicts may frustrate the public \\ninterest, as well as the objectives of the Federal Government, \\ncertain owners, and participants, in facilitating the reporting of \\nswap transactions. Therefore, in establishing governance \\narrangements that are transparent as to (i) the sources of such \\ncontrol and (ii) the decisions resulting from such control, the SDR \\nmay be satisfying Core Principles 2 and 3 simultaneously.\\'\\' Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In addition, the Commission discussed the commercial value of swap \\ndata and SDR analyses of SDR information and the incentive that a \\ncontrol group may have to ``(i) limit or burden access to such analyses \\non a discriminatory basis; or (ii) disclose or use the data of other \\nreporting entities for its own competitive purposes (e.g., front-\\nrunning).\\'\\' \\\\272\\\\ The Commission also stated that ``the control group \\nmay also have an incentive to cause the SDR to provide such data to an \\naffiliate for derivative applications or ancillary services (especially \\nif such applications or services are bundled).\\'\\' \\\\273\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\272\\\\ Id. at 80919.\\n    \\\\273\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is concerned that a control group can dominate an \\nSDR to further its economic interests to the detriment of other \\nreporting entities. The Commission proposed Sec.  49.21 to implement \\nCore Principle 3 and to mitigate this and other conflicts that may \\narise in the operation of an SDR. Proposed Sec.  49.21(a) required each \\nregistered SDR to establish and enforce rules to minimize conflicts of \\ninterest in the decision-making process of the SDR, and establish a \\nprocess for resolving such conflicts of interest. The Commission also \\nproposed in Sec.  49.21(b) that each registered SDR maintain and \\nenforce rules (i) that would identify, on an ongoing basis, existing \\nand potential conflicts of interest; and (ii) that would enable the SDR \\nto make decisions if a conflict exists. As stated in the SDR NPRM, the \\nCommission believes such rules should require, at a minimum, the \\nrecusal of any person involved in the conflict from such decision-\\nmaking.\\n    The Commission received three comments on the identification of \\nconflicts of interest and proposed Sec.  49.21.\\\\274\\\\ AFR expressed \\nconcern regarding the vulnerability of SDRs to significant conflicts of \\ninterest that could interfere with their public utility mission.\\\\275\\\\ \\nSpecifically, AFR expressed concern that ``the owners of SDRs could use \\npreferential access to the information gathered to favor some market \\nparticipants at the expense of others, or to deny transparent pricing \\ninformation to customers.\\'\\' \\\\276\\\\ DTCC reiterated its view that \\npotential conflicts of interest are best addressed by open access \\nprovisions, governance that is independent from its affiliates, and a \\nmarket participant owned SDR.\\\\277\\\\ ABC/CIEBA voiced concerns relating \\nto swap counterparties who are SDs/MSPs electing the SDR to be used \\nwhere the SD/MSP has an ownership or governance interest in the SDR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\274\\\\ See CL-AFR, CL-DTCC I and CL-ABC/CIEBA supra note 51.\\n    \\\\275\\\\ CL-AFR supra note 51 at 1.\\n    \\\\276\\\\ Id. at 2.\\n    \\\\277\\\\ CL-DTCC I and CL-DTCC II supra note 51 at 17 and 2, \\nrespectively.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For swaps that could be cleared by multiple SDRs, ABC/CIEBA \\nsuggested that, if the Commission required the swap counterparty that \\nis not the SD/MSP to elect the SDR to be used, then such requirement \\nmay address potential conflicts of interest where the SD/MSP has an \\nownership or governance interest in a particular SDR and then attempts \\nto steer reported trades to the SDR.\\\\278\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\278\\\\ CL-ABC/CIEBA supra note 51 at 13.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is adopting Sec.  49.21(a) and (b) as proposed. The \\nCommission believes that the substantive requirements of Sec. Sec.  \\n49.20 and 49.21 (e.g., transparency of governance arrangements, \\nconsideration of an independent perspective, policies and procedures on \\nconflicts of interest) appropriately mitigate SDR conflicts of \\ninterest, especially in conjunction with (i) non-discrimination \\nrequirements regarding access and fees; and (ii) limitations on \\ndisclosure and use of non-public information. In addition, Sec.  49.21 \\nsimply requires an SDR to have policies and procedures to (i) identify, \\non an ongoing basis, existing and potential conflicts of interest; and \\n(ii) make decisions in the event of a conflict of interest. Even \\nassuming that the specified requirements resolve all current conflicts \\nof interest, they may not be sufficient to address future conflicts. \\nThus, the Commission believes that having policies and procedures to \\nresolve future as well as current conflicts is central to compliance \\nwith Core Principle 3. With respect to ABC/CIEBA\\'s comment, the \\nCommission believes that if an SD/MSP elects to report transactions at \\nan SDR that it owns or governs, that action may constitute a SD/MSP \\nconflict (presuming that such election does not serve the interests of \\nits swap counterparties), but not an SDR conflict under Core Principle \\n3. The Commission will consider this comment in connection with its \\nfinal rulemaking for Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting \\nRequirements.\\\\279\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\279\\\\ See Data NPRM supra note 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n5. Core Principle Compliance\\n    Both proposed Sec.  49.20(d) and Sec.  49.21(c) required the SDR\\'s \\nCCO to review the compliance of the SDR with Core Principles 2 and 3, \\nrespectively. The Commission received one comment letter discussing SDR \\nand DCO core principle compliance. CME suggested that a DCO that is \\nalso registered as an SDR should be able to achieve compliance with SDR \\ncore principles by demonstrating compliance with applicable DCO core \\nprinciples.\\\\280\\\\ The Commission has considered CME\\'s comment and \\nmaintains that DCOs which are SDRs are responsible for compliance with \\nthe SDR core principles. Should a particular DCO core principle be \\nidentical in its requirements to an SDR core principle, compliance with \\nthe latter could be demonstrated by showing compliance with the \\nformer.\\\\281\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\280\\\\ CL-CME supra note 51 at 2-3.\\n    \\\\281\\\\ The Commission reiterates that if a DCO registers as an \\nSDR the DCO would be expected to meet the more stringent set of \\nrules to the extent that the SDR and DCO final rules on governance \\nand conflicts of interest differ. See also SDR NPRM supra note 8 at \\n80899 n.9.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 54567]]\\n\\nE. Additional Duties\\n\\n    In addition to the core principles set forth above in section D, \\nsection 21(f)(4) of the CEA authorized the Commission to prescribe \\nadditional duties for SDRs for the purpose of minimizing conflicts of \\ninterest, protecting data, ensuring compliance and guaranteeing the \\nsafety and security of the SDR. In its SDR NPRM, the Commission \\nproposed four additional duties that would require an SDR to (i) adopt \\nand implement system safeguards, including BC-DR plans; (ii) maintain \\nsufficient financial resources; (iii) furnish to market participants a \\ndisclosure document setting forth the risks and costs associated with \\nusing the services of the SDR; and (iv) provide fair and open access to \\nthe SDR and fees that are equitable and non-discriminatory. In \\nconnection with final part 49 regulations, the Commission has adopted \\nonly three of the four proposed additional duties pursuant to section \\n21(f)(4). The Commission has determined that the statutory authority \\nfor adopting proposed Sec.  49.24 relating to system safeguards is \\nproperly and adequately established in section 21(c)(8) of the CEA, and \\nthis is not an additional duty imposed under the authority of section \\n21(f)(4). Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is unnecessary \\nto use its discretion under section 21(f)(4) of the CEA to adopt Sec.  \\n49.24. A description of the three additional duties and related \\ncomments are discussed in turn below.\\n1. Financial Resources--Sec.  49.25\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.25(a)(1) required an SDR to maintain sufficient \\nfinancial resources to fulfill its responsibilities as set forth in \\nproposed Sec.  49.9 and the core principles set forth in proposed Sec.  \\n49.19. As described in the SDR NPRM, the Commission believes that \\n``requiring SDRs to maintain sufficient financial resources will help \\nto ensure the protection of the swap data maintained by the SDR as well \\nas the safety and security of the SDR.\\'\\' \\\\282\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\282\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80937.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.25(b) established that the financial resources \\nrelied upon by the SDR to meet its obligations under paragraph (a) may \\ninclude the SDR\\'s own capital and any other financial resource \\nacceptable to the Commission.\\\\283\\\\ Additionally, proposed Sec.  \\n49.25(c) provided that an SDR must compute, at least on a quarterly \\nbasis, its financial resource requirement, making a reasonable \\ncalculation of its projected operating costs over a 12-month period. \\nThe proposed rule allowed the SDR reasonable discretion in determining \\nthe methodology used to compute such projected operating costs, \\nalthough the Commission reserved the right to review the methodology \\nutilized by the SDR and require changes as appropriate.\\\\284\\\\ Similarly, \\nunder proposed Sec.  49.25(d), an SDR must undertake to compute, at \\nleast quarterly, ``the current market value of each financial resource \\nused to meet its obligations under [Sec.  49.25(a)]\\'\\' with appropriate \\nreductions in value (haircuts) applied to reflect market and credit \\nrisk.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\283\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\284\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission requested comment on ``whether the methodology set \\nforth [in Sec.  49.25] for determining sufficient financial resources \\nwould provide the necessary resources to ensure the financial integrity \\nof the SDR.\\'\\' \\\\285\\\\ If not, the Commission requested that commenters \\nsubmit different methodologies or manner for calculating sufficient SDR \\nfinancial resources.\\\\286\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\285\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80920.\\n    \\\\286\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission received three comments relating to the financial \\nresources required of SDRs.\\\\287\\\\ While the letters were generally \\nsupportive of the proposed rules and their objectives, the commenters \\narticulated concern with respect to (1) the length of the resource \\nrequirement; (2) the types of financial resources required by the \\nCommission; (3) the use of a parent company\\'s financial resources for \\npurposes of Sec.  49.25; and (4) the reporting of an SDR\\'s solvency \\nratio.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\287\\\\ See CL-Barnard, CL-Reval and CL-TriOptima supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    One area of concern was the proposed requirement in Sec.  \\n49.25(a)(3) that an SDR\\'s financial resources would only be considered \\nsufficient if their value were equal to the total operating costs of \\nthe SDR for a period of at least one year. Reval believed that SDRs \\nshould not be required to have 12 months of operating expenses on an \\non-going basis. It argued that requiring 12 months of operating \\nexpenses on hand ``would not be how most businesses operate and would \\nbe prohibitive to many new businesses from forming an SDR * * * .\\'\\' \\n\\\\288\\\\ In addition, it noted that such a requirement would ``be a \\nconstraint limiting the SDRs from: improving technology, having the \\nproper resources, and making other long-term investments.\\'\\' \\\\289\\\\ Chris \\nBarnard, on the other hand, articulated support for the ``requirement \\nthat an SDR maintain financial resources exceeding the total amount \\nthat would cover its operating costs for a 1-year rolling period.\\'\\' \\n\\\\290\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\288\\\\ CL-Reval supra note 51 at 10.\\n    \\\\289\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\290\\\\ CL-Barnard supra note 51 at 4. The Commission notes that \\nits proposal under Sec.  49.25(a)(3) required that the financial \\nresource of an SDR be at least equal to its operating costs for at \\nleast one year, calculated on a rolling basis.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    A second area of concern was the types of financial resources \\ndeemed acceptable by the Commission in proposed Sec.  49.25(b). Reval\\'s \\ncomment letter argued for broader allowances in the measures used to \\ndetermine whether an SDR has sufficient resources. It suggested the \\nCommission consider an SDR\\'s profitability, level of positive operating \\ncash flow, and cash balance. Reval also suggested that perhaps \\ninitially an SDR should be allowed to demonstrate sufficient working \\ncapital either directly, or through its parent company, or from debt, \\nletters of credit or capital call structures. Under Reval\\'s plan, after \\nan initial 12-month period an SDR should ``be able to demonstrate that \\nit has adequate financial support from one or more of the following: \\npositive operating cash flow, six months of operating expenses on hand, \\nor profitability on a quarterly basis.\\'\\' \\\\291\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\291\\\\ CL-Reval supra note 51 at 10-11.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Reval and TriOptima offered comments on parent company \\ncontributions to SDR resources and, conversely, on their contribution \\nto an SDR\\'s calculated resource requirements for purposes of Sec.  \\n49.25. Reval suggested that ``[n]ot allowing the SDR to be financially \\nsupported by a parent company may also limit the pool of companies \\nwilling to register to become an SDR as it would involve raising new \\ncapital for a start-up business.\\'\\' \\\\292\\\\ TriOptima believes that the \\n``proposed rule should be drafted broadly enough to recognize that an \\nSDR may be a stand-alone entity or a unit or division of a larger \\nentity\\'\\' and that the financial resource requirements be limited to the \\nactivities of the SDR ``and not to the broader activities of the entity \\nas a whole.\\'\\' \\\\293\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\292\\\\ CL-Reval supra note 51 at 10.\\n    \\\\293\\\\ CL-TriOptima letter supra note 51 at 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Lastly, Chris Barnard suggested that, in addition to the proposed \\nrequirements in Sec.  49.25, an SDR should be required to calculate and \\nregularly publish a solvency ratio and that such ratio should not fall \\nbelow 105%.\\\\294\\\\ Barnard also believes that the ``CFTC should be \\nimmediately notified when the Solvency Ratio falls below 105%.\\'\\' \\\\295\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\294\\\\ CL-Barnard supra note 51 at 4.\\n    \\\\295\\\\ CL-Barnard supra note 51 at 4.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Proposed Sec.  49.25 was intended to ensure the protection of the \\nswap data maintained by the SDRs, the financial\\n\\n[[Page 54568]]\\n\\nsafety and security of SDRs, and an orderly wind-down of individual \\nSDRs without disruption to the markets., The framework established by \\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and envisioned in the Commission\\'s proposed \\nregulations places important responsibilities upon all SDRs to serve as \\ncentralized storehouses of swap transaction data, facilitate \\nregulators\\' surveillance of swaps markets, and help mitigate systemic \\nrisk in the financial system. As described above, SDRs\\' \\nresponsibilities will include accepting swap data from counterparties, \\nconfirming the accuracy of the swap data, and maintaining data \\naccording to standards prescribed by the Commission. SDRs may also \\ndisseminate swap transaction data to the public, on a real-time basis, \\nand will engage in monitoring, screening, and analyzing swap data to \\nassist the Commission in the fulfillment of its regulatory objectives \\nwith respect to the swap markets. Given the vital importance of the \\nfunctions described above, the Commission believes that adequate \\nfinancial resource requirements are of the upmost importance for all \\nSDRs. Accordingly, the Commission disagrees with Reval\\'s suggestion \\nthat an SDR should be subject to the proposed financial resource \\nrequirements only for the initial 12 months, and to a lower standard \\nafter the first year of operation, as the important responsibilities \\nplaced upon an SDR continue past its first year of operation. \\nAdditionally, sufficient resources to execute an orderly wind-down will \\nbe crucial to any SDR no matter how long it has been in business. The \\nCommission believes that proposed Sec.  49.25(a) strikes a proper \\nbalance between the potential barrier to entry posed by its financial \\nresources requirements, on the one hand, and the protection of a \\nsystemically important entity, on the other.\\\\296\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\296\\\\ The Commission in the final adoption of Sec.  49.25(a)(2), \\nrelating to DCOs that also operate as SDRs, revised the reference to \\nDCO financial resource requirements to refer to Sec.  39.11 of the \\nCommission\\'s Regulations rather than ``core principles.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission acknowledges the detailed alternatives articulated \\nin Reval\\'s comment letter regarding the types of financial resources \\nthat should be acceptable in satisfaction of the requirements proposed \\nin Sec.  49.25(a). In particular, Reval suggested that measures to \\ndetermine if an SDR has sufficient resources to ensure the financial \\nintegrity of the SDR could include the SDRs profitability, level of \\npositive operating cash flow, and cash balance. After considering these \\nalternative measures, however, the Commission has determined to adopt \\nSec.  49.25(b) as proposed. The Commission again notes that the purpose \\nof proposed Sec.  49.25 was not only to ensure the continued viability \\nof an operating SDR, but also the orderly wind-down of a failing SDR. \\nAs such, the intent of the rule is to be certain that each SDR has \\nsufficient capital on hand to cover its operating costs for one year, \\nregardless of its profitability or cash flow; Reval\\'s proposed \\nalternatives do not capture this intent. The Commission emphasizes that \\nthe provision Sec.  49.25(b)(2) stating that the acceptable financial \\nresources include an SDR\\'s own capital and ``any other financial \\nresources deemed acceptable by the Commission\\'\\' was meant to capture \\nother types of resources on a case-by-case basis and provide \\nflexibility to SDRs and the Commission.\\\\297\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\297\\\\ For example, the Commission believes that commitments from \\nequity investors to provide the resources necessary to fulfill the \\nSDR\\'s responsibilities would satisfy the requirements of Sec.  \\n49.25(b).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission also disagrees with Reval that, at least initially, \\nan SDR should be able to demonstrate sufficient working capital through \\na letter of credit or similar type of credit facility. The Commission \\nclarifies that a letter of credit should not be taken into account in \\ncalculating the financial resource requirement in proposed Sec.  \\n49.25(a). However, an SDR may be able to take into account a committed \\nletter of credit or line of credit for the six month liquidity \\nrequirement in proposed Sec.  49.25(e) if there are no, or very few, \\nrestrictions on the credit and, for example, the credit is available \\neven if the SDR\\'s financial position changes in a materially adverse \\nmanner.\\n    Finally, the Commission is not adopting Reval\\'s recommendation that \\nan SDR should be allowed to be financially supported by a parent \\ncompany. The Commission believes that when relying on the resources of \\na parent company, there is a risk that future capital contributions, \\neven if contractually obligated, will not be paid if an SDR must wind-\\ndown its business. Due to the risk of potential harm caused from \\npossible data loss and market disruptions, the Commission does not view \\nthis as a viable alternative. Conversely, the Commission does agree \\nwith TriOptima that an SDR\\'s financial resource requirements should be \\nlimited to the activities of the SDR and not to the broader activities \\nof the parent company.\\n    The Commission also declines to adopt Barnard\\'s recommendation that \\nan SDR be required to calculate and publish its solvency ratio. \\nAccordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  49.25 as proposed.\\n3. Disclosure Requirements of Swap Data Repositories--Sec.  49.25\\n    The Commission proposed that SDRs furnish market participants a \\ndisclosure document (``SDR Disclosure Document\\'\\') setting forth the \\nrisks and costs associated with using the services of the SDR. \\nSpecifically, Sec.  49.26 required that each SDR Disclosure Document \\ncontain the following information:\\n    <bullet> The SDR\\'s criteria for providing others with access to \\nservices offered and data maintained by the SDR;\\n    <bullet> The SDR\\'s criteria for those seeking to connect to or link \\nwith the SDR;\\n    <bullet> A description of the SDR\\'s policies and procedures \\nregarding its safeguarding of data and operational reliability, as \\ndescribed in proposed Sec.  49.24;\\n    <bullet> The SDR\\'s policies and procedures designed to protect the \\nprivacy and confidentiality of any and all swap transaction information \\nthat the SDR receives from market participants, as described in \\nproposed Sec.  49.16;\\n    <bullet> The SDR\\'s policies and procedures regarding its non-\\ncommercial and/or commercial use of the swap data;\\n    <bullet> The SDR\\'s dispute resolution procedures involving market \\nparticipant;\\n    <bullet> A description of all the SDR\\'s services, including any \\nancillary services;\\n    <bullet> The SDR\\'s updated schedule of any fees, rates, dues, \\nunbundled prices, or other charges for all of its services, including \\nany ancillary services; any discounts or rebates offered; and the \\ncriteria to benefit from such discounts or rebates; and\\n    <bullet> A description of the SDR\\'s governance arrangements.\\n    The Commission in proposing this disclosure requirement believed it \\nwould benefit market participants and the swap market generally by \\nhelping to (i) minimize conflicts of interest; and (ii) ensure SDR \\ncompliance with its statutory responsibilities and duties.\\n    The Commission received a comment from DTCC related to the proposal \\nthat SDRs furnish a disclosure document outlining the costs and risks \\nof using such services.\\\\298\\\\ DTCC noted in particular the requirements \\nset forth in Sec.  49.26 and indicated that they provide market \\nparticipants with sufficient disclosure of the costs and risks through \\ndisclosure documents and other information provided on their Web site.\\n\\n[[Page 54569]]\\n\\nThe Commission believes that the prominent posting of the SDR \\nDisclosure Document itself or the information contained in the SDR \\nDisclosure Document on an SDR\\'s Web site is sufficient for compliance \\nwith this Sec.  49.26.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\298\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 25.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission notes that the disclosure of SDR costs and risks \\nwill provide market participants with information regarding SDR \\noperations that is essential for informed decision-making. \\nSpecifically, the Commission believes that it is especially important \\nfor market participants to know an SDR\\'s policies and procedures \\nrelating to the safeguarding and use of reported data as well as the \\noperational capability and reliability of the SDR.\\n    After reviewing Sec.  49.26 generally and the comment received, the \\nCommission is adopting Sec.  49.26 as proposed.\\n4. Access and Fees--Sec.  49.27\\n    The Commission proposed in Sec.  49.27 to establish open, non-\\ndiscriminatory access to the services provided by SDRs. The Commission \\nbelieves that the Dodd-Frank Act requires SDRs to provide services on a \\nnon-discriminatory basis based largely on the requirement in section \\n2(a)(13)(G) of the CEA \\\\299\\\\ that all swap transactions be reported to \\nan SDR. The Commission further believes that the intent and purpose of \\nsection 21 of the CEA \\\\300\\\\ is for SDRs to provide open and equal \\naccess to its services. Consistent with the principles of open and \\nequal access to SDR services, the Commission submits that the fees or \\ncharges adopted by an SDR must also be equitable and otherwise non-\\ndiscriminatory.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\299\\\\ See section 727 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\\n    \\\\300\\\\ See section 728 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(a) Access\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.27(a) required that the services provided by \\nSDRs be available to all market participants, such as DCMs, SEFs, DCOs, \\nSDs, MSPs and any other counterparty, on a fair, open and equal basis. \\nSDRs that register and agree to accept swap data in a particular asset \\nclass (such as interest rates or commodities) could not offer their \\nservices on a discriminatory basis to select market participants or \\nselect categories of market participants. The Commission continues to \\nbelieve that access should be fair, open and equal.\\n    The Commission received four comment letters from interested \\nparties relating to open access.\\\\301\\\\ Several additional comments \\nrelating to fees (discussed below) that raise open access issues will \\nalso be discussed in connection with the fee provisions of Sec.  \\n49.27(b).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\301\\\\ See CL-ABC/CIEBA, CL-DTCC II and CL-MarkitServ I supra \\nnote 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ABC/CIEBA asserted that the ``open access\\'\\' provision set forth in \\nproposed Sec.  49.27(a) could allow an SDR to set discriminatory \\nrestrictions on the type of swap transaction terms it could receive to \\nthe detriment of benefit and pension plans. ABC/CIEBA requested the \\nCommission in its adoption of Sec.  49.27(a) provide additional clarity \\nthat an SDR may not ``* * * require, as a condition to reporting a swap \\ntransaction or providing information to an SDR, that a counterparty be \\nexposed to more liability (via a user agreement or otherwise) than it \\nwould have otherwise been exposed to had its transaction not been \\nreported to the SDR.\\'\\' \\\\302\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\302\\\\ CL-ABC/CIEBA supra note 51 at 5.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission in the SDR NPRM recognized the potential difficulty \\nfor plan fiduciaries in managing benefit plans, and accordingly, \\nproposed Sec.  49.10(c) to partly address concerns regarding the \\nmodification or invalidation of swap transaction terms. In addition, \\nSec.  49.27(a), as proposed, was intended to prevent discriminatory \\naccess to SDR services.\\n    The Commission believes that ABC/CIEBA\\'s proposed clarification is \\noverly broad, and may place an SDR in a position to determine whether \\nany given counterparty will be exposed to additional liability--even a \\nnon- reporting counterparty\\'s. The Commission submits that this could \\nplace the SDR in a position of evaluating risks outside of the \\nstatutory mandate imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Therefore, the \\nCommission believes that the measures proposed in Sec. Sec.  49.10(c) \\nand 49.27(a) to prevent modification and invalidation and to ensure \\nfair and equal access adequately address ABC/CIEBA\\'s concerns.\\n    DTCC commented that SDRs should provide open access to services \\noffered while also preserving the trading parties\\' control over the \\nreported data maintained by the SDR.\\\\303\\\\ DTCC specifically believes \\nthat agents of a reporting party (such as a SEF, DCO, confirmation \\nfacility or other service provider) must be acting on behalf of the \\nreporting counterparty and submits that the particular SDR for which \\nthe trade is reported should be based on the counterparty\\'s selection \\nand not by the SEF, DCO, confirmation facility or other service \\nprovider.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\303\\\\ CL-DTCC II supra note 51 at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Although the Commission largely shares DTCC\\'s views regarding the \\nauthority of the reporting counterparty to choose or select the \\nparticular SDR for the reporting of swaps, the Commission submits that \\nthis authority to select a particular SDR may be contractually \\ndelegated to other parties. In addition, the rules and regulations of a \\nparticular SEF, DCM or DCO may provide for the reporting to a \\nparticular SDR. However, the Commission notes that this would not \\nprevent the counterparties from also reporting their swap transaction \\ndata to an additional SDR for recordkeeping and other risk management \\nor ancillary purposes consistent with the requirements set forth in \\nproposed part 45 of the Commission\\'s Regulations. Accordingly, the \\nCommission believes that the reporting of swap transaction data to SDRs \\nis adequately addressed in proposed part 45 of the Commission\\'s \\nRegulations \\\\304\\\\ and section 4r(3) of the CEA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\304\\\\ See Data NPRM supra note 6.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    MarkitSERV commented that it generally supports the proposed open \\naccess and fee provision set forth in Sec.  49.27.\\\\305\\\\ However, \\nMarkitSERV believes that if Sec.  49.27 is implemented, as proposed, it \\nmay have some unintended consequences. In particular, MarkitSERV \\nasserted that without clarification as to the meaning of ``non-\\ndiscriminatory\\'\\' fees and ``preferential pricing arrangements,\\'\\' the \\n``dealer-pays\\'\\' fee structure historically used by SDR-like entities \\ncould be seen as preferential.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\305\\\\ CL-MarkitServ I supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    MarkitSERV believes that the current ``dealer pays\\'\\' pricing model \\nensures fair and open access because buy-side participants are often \\nsmaller entities that may find it difficult to afford SDR fees. \\nMarkitSERV is concerned that without clarification the proposed \\nregulation could cause an increase in costs for buy-side market \\nparticipants, and thereby, discourage the use of SDRs. The Commission \\nbelieves that this argument ignores the statutory mandate that all \\nswaps whether cleared or uncleared must be reported to an SDR.\\\\306\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\306\\\\ Section 2(a)(13)(G) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(13)(G).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission further believes that, consistent with fair, open \\nand equal access, an SDR may appropriately utilize any pricing model \\nsubject to Sec.  49.27(b)\\'s requirement that such fees be non-\\ndiscriminatory. The Commission notes that ``open access\\'\\' and ``non-\\ndiscriminatory\\'\\' fees are complementary notions of fair dealing and \\nopen market access that are necessary in order for compliance with the \\nstatutory mandate\\n\\n[[Page 54570]]\\n\\nset forth in the Dodd-Frank Act that all swaps be reported to an SDR.\\n    The Commission also received several comments in connection with \\nthe issue of bundling or tying of SDR regulatory services with \\nancillary services.\\\\307\\\\ DTCC urged the Commission to prohibit the \\nbundling of core regulatory services mandated by the Dodd-Frank and \\npart 49 with non-core or ancillary services. Similarly, MarkitSERV also \\nrecommended that the SDR regulations be amended to explicitly prohibit \\ntying of core services and ancillary services. MarkitSERV also \\ncommented that SDRs be allowed (but not required) to offer an array of \\nservices that are ancillary to those narrowly defined duties outlined \\nin the Dodd-Frank Act and part 49. TriOptima requested clarification on \\nthe ability of an SDR or its affiliates to offer ancillary services on \\nterms commercially agreed to between the SDR and its customer/\\nsubscriber.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\307\\\\ See CL-DTCC, CL-MarkitSERV, CL-MarkitSERV II and CL-\\nTriOptima supra note 51. The Commission understands ancillary \\nservices to consist of asset servicing; confirmation, verification \\nand affirmation facilities; collateral management, settlement, trade \\ncompression and netting services; valuation, pricing and \\nreconciliation functionalities; position limits management; dispute \\nresolution; and counterparty identify verification.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that it is appropriate for SDRs to offer \\nancillary services to market participants. However, SDRs in offering \\nsuch ancillary services are prohibited from bundling these services \\nwith mandated regulatory services such as swap data reporting. \\nAccordingly, the Commission is revising Sec.  49.27 to clarify that \\nSDRs are prohibited from requiring market participants to make use of \\nSDR ancillary services in order to gain access to the SDR\\'s mandated \\nregulatory services.\\n    For the reasons discussed above, the Commission is adopting Sec.  \\n49.27(a) largely as proposed with the modification relating to bundling \\nnoted above.\\n(b) Fees\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.27(b) ensured that fees or other charges \\nestablished by an SDR are not used as a means to deny access to some \\nmarket participants by employing disparate and/or discriminatory \\npricing. The Commission continues to be concerned that SDRs could \\nattempt to adopt disparate pricing for performing their statutory \\nduties and obligations set forth in section 21 of the CEA. The \\nCommission believes that such action would be inconsistent with Core \\nPrinciple 3 discussed above, the CEA generally, and the guiding \\nprinciples set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act.\\n    The Commission recognizes that SDRs will be subjected to \\nsignificant costs both in connection with part 49, as well as the \\nrecordkeeping and reporting of swap data as proposed in part 45 and \\nreal-time public reporting as proposed in part 43.\\\\308\\\\ These costs, in \\npart, include the ability to accept and maintain reported swaps data, \\ntechnology, personnel, technical support and appropriate BC-DR plans. \\nAccordingly, Sec.  49.27(b), as proposed, seeks to ensure that the fees \\ncharged to reporting parties are equitable and do not become an \\nartificial barrier to access. The Commission is concerned that the \\nswaps markets are dominated by a select number of financial entities \\nand related utilities, and therefore, sought through proposed Sec.  \\n49.27 to promote fair and open competition for SDR services.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\308\\\\ See SDR NPRM supra note 8 and Real-Time NPRM supra note \\n28.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As proposed, Sec.  49.27(b) prohibited SDRs from offering \\npreferential pricing arrangements to any market participant, including \\nvolume discounts or reductions, unless such discounts or reductions \\napply to all market participants uniformly and are not otherwise \\nestablished in a manner that would effectively limit the application of \\nsuch discount or reduction to a market participant or a select number \\nof market participants. Proposed Sec.  49.27 also would require SDRs to \\nprovide fee transparency to market participants through its Web site as \\nwell as in the Disclosure Document discussed above in Sec.  49.26.\\n    The Commission received seven comment letters relating to SDR \\npricing from various interested parties.\\\\309\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\309\\\\ See CL-Reval I, CL-MarkitSERV I, CL-Sungard, CL-DTCC I, \\nCL-AFR and CL-Better Market supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Reval commented that the core component of pricing will be a per \\ntransaction charge with each SDR having varying costs and quality of \\nservice. Reval thought that a comparison of pricing among SDRs may be \\ndifficult because of the many aspects that will comprise SDR pricing. \\nReval submitted that SDRs should be able to charge for client \\nimplementation, consulting or development services that are separate \\nand apart from the ``core\\'\\' regulatory services of SDR reporting. Given \\nthe level of transparency as proposed by the Commission in Sec.  49.27, \\nReval expects robust price competition under the assumption that \\nseveral SDRs become registered.\\n    MarkitSERV generally supported the principle set forth in proposed \\nSec.  49.27 that fees charged by SDRs must be equitable and established \\nin a uniform and non-discriminatory manner. However, as discussed \\nabove, MarkitSERV questioned the application of ``non-discriminatory\\'\\' \\nfees and ``preferential pricing arrangements,\\'\\' based on its belief \\nthat current repository fee structures are preferential. For example, \\nMarkitSERV commented that current trade repositories commonly require \\nonly dealer participants to pay for the cost of reporting swaps.\\\\310\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\310\\\\ CL-MarkitSERV I supra note 51 at 4. The Commission submits \\nin a reporting party fee pricing model that reporting fees paid by \\nSD/MSP reporting counterparties to an SDR would be factored into the \\npricing between the SD/MSP and its buy-side customer so that the \\nbuy-side customer does not directly pay for reporting.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As discussed above, MarkitSERV is concerned that, without \\nclarification, the regulation as proposed could increase the costs for \\nend-users (buy-side participants) and thereby discourage end-users from \\nusing SDRs. In addition to the reasons discussed above, the Commission \\nbelieves that this argument fails to address the reporting regime set \\nforth in the Data NPRM and section 4r of the CEA, and further, assumes \\nthat a single entity serves as the SDR so that buy-side participants \\nare unable to ``shop\\'\\' for competitive pricing.\\n    MarkitSERV recommended that the Commission explicitly endorse the \\n``dealer pays\\'\\' commercial model. DTCC echoed MarkitSERV\\'s approach \\nwith its view that fee structures should reflect an ``at cost\\'\\' pricing \\nmodel with only SDs subject to fees.\\\\311\\\\ Alternatively, MarkitSERV \\nthought the Commission could clarify Sec.  49.27, as proposed, so that \\ndifferent fee structures for different classes of participants would \\nnot be deemed discriminatory as long as the pricing model is not \\ndiscriminatory within those classes. In addition, MarkitSERV also \\nasserted that adopting a ``reporting party pays\\'\\' pricing model would \\nmeet the Commission\\'s objectives of uniform and non-discriminatory \\nfees. Lastly, MarkitSERV asserted that the application of Sec.  49.27 \\nto ancillary services may prove detrimental to the market. MarkitSERV \\nbelieves that because ancillary services are non-core services, and \\ntherefore, may be provided independently by un-regulated third-party \\nservice providers, these services should be priced commercially and \\nconsistently with market practices if they are also offered by SDRs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\311\\\\ CL-DTCC I supra note 51 at 3.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Sungard acknowledged the Commission\\'s rationale for applying an\\n\\n[[Page 54571]]\\n\\nequitable standard to fees charged by SDRs and supports the \\nCommission\\'s decision in Sec.  49.27 to refrain from acting as a ``rate \\nsetter\\'\\' with respect to the establishment of SDR fees. Sungard \\nspecifically noted that proposed Sec.  49.27(b)(3) does not call for \\nspecific Commission review and approval of fees. The Commission notes \\nthat although SDR fees would not be ``approved,\\'\\' any and all fees \\ncharged by SDRs will be filed with the Commission and subject to \\nsufficient transparency and disclosure via the SDR\\'s Web site and SDR \\nDisclosure Document. AFR recommended that all market participants be \\ntreated equally by requiring SDRs to provide the Commission with a \\njustification for its fees.\\n    The Commission does not endorse or adopt any particular business or \\npricing model but instead believes that any regulation should permit a \\nvariety of business models to flourish. Accordingly, the Commission is \\nadopting Sec.  49.27 as proposed. The Commission submits that a \\ndetermination of what may constitute an ``equitable\\'\\' and ``non-\\ndiscriminatory\\'\\' price must be performed on a case-by-case basis. In \\nresponse to DTCC, the Commission believes that the cost of offering a \\nservice or product is not determinative, but is one factor in this \\nanalysis.\\\\312\\\\ The Commission in proposing Sec.  49.27 was careful not \\nto designate or sanction any particular pricing or business model \\nrelating to SDRs. Instead, the Commission seeks to foster or encourage \\ncompetition as the best way in which to keep swap reporting costs to a \\nminimum.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\312\\\\ See e.g. Report of SEC Advisory Committee On Market \\nInformation: A Blueprint For Responsible Change (September 14, 2001) \\n(known as the ``Seligman Report\\'\\') available at <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/marketinfo/finalreport.htm\">http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/marketinfo/finalreport.htm</a>. See also, SEC, \\nConcept Release: Regulation of Market Information Fees and Revenues, \\nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 42208 (December 9, 1999), 64 FR \\n70613 (December 17, 1999). Cost basis pricing in connection with \\nnational securities exchange market data fees was recently discussed \\nin NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 615 F.3d 525 \\n(DC Cir. 2010).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Given the varying cost structures and business models that may \\nemerge, the Commission will not approve or set ``fees.\\'\\' In addition, \\nthe Commission believes that the Dodd-Frank Act and the CEA requires \\nthe Commission, to the extent possible, to promote competition between \\nand among various SDRs. The Commission notes that Sec.  49.27 would \\nprohibit SDRs from establishing fees in a manner that restrict fair, \\nfree and open access to SDR services.\\n    Both AFR and Better Markets argue that the Commission should \\nprohibit volume discounts in SDR pricing based on their belief that \\nmost reporting flow will be ``dealer dominated,\\'\\' and therefore, \\nunfairly discriminate against non-SDs/MSPs (i.e. end-users). This may \\nbe true for more ``customized\\'\\' swap transactions; however, for those \\nmore standardized transactions that may be executed on a SEF or DCM, \\nreporting to an SDR would be part of the SEF\\'s or DCM\\'s transaction \\nservices. Accordingly, the reporting flow in these cases would be \\ndetermined by the SEF or DCM and not the SD/MSP. In addition, SDs/MSPs \\nwill be required to negotiate customer agreements with non-SD/MSP \\ncounterparties so that volume pricing discounts should otherwise be \\nreflected in the pricing structure to the non-SD/MSP counterparty. This \\nwill especially be the case because any fees charged by SDRs for \\nservices must be transparent and disclosed publicly.\\n    Accordingly, the Commission will permit volume discounts as long as \\nthese discounts are not structured in a way that is anti-competitive. \\nHowever, the Commission expects to study the effect of volume discounts \\nthat are offered by SDRs, and will re-evaluate both its view and Sec.  \\n49.27, if warranted.\\n    With respect to MarkitSERV and DTCC\\'s comments relating to the \\n``dealer pays\\'\\' commercial pricing model, the Commission is not \\nentirely persuaded regarding this recommendation but does agree that an \\nSDR may appropriately utilize a pricing model by which the reporting \\nentity is required to pay the SDR reporting fees. In this manner, the \\nreporting entity--SD, MSP or non-SD/MSP--and its counterparty will as \\npart of their agreement negotiate the payment of SDR fees. Consistent \\nwith MarkitSERV\\'s comments, the Commission believes that SDRs may \\ncharge participants a reasonable fee to recoup additional costs \\nassociated with accepting and processing ``customized\\'\\' reportable \\ntransactions to the SDR.\\n\\nF. Procedures for Implementing Swap Data Repository Rules\\n\\n    The Commission\\'s part 40 regulations contain provisions related to \\nsubmissions to the Commission by registered entities of new products \\nand rules. In order to implement new statutory provisions imposed by \\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission has adopted amendments to its part \\n40 rules.\\\\313\\\\ These amendments implement a new statutory framework for \\ncertification and approval procedures for new products, new rules and \\nrule amendments submitted to the Commission by registered entities and, \\nas relevant to this rulemaking, include new registered entities such as \\nSDRs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\313\\\\ See Part 40 supra note 21.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In this connection, the Commission proposed Sec.  49.8 to conform \\nto the framework established in the part 40 rules. The proposed rule \\nprovided that an applicant for registration as an SDR may request that \\nthe Commission approve, pursuant to section 5c(c) of the CEA, any or \\nall of its rules and subsequent amendments, either prior to \\nimplementation or, notwithstanding the provisions of section 5c(c)(2) \\nof the CEA, at any time thereafter, under the procedures established in \\nSec.  40.5 of the Commission\\'s Regulations. Under the proposal, rules \\nof an SDR not voluntarily submitted for prior Commission approval as \\ndescribed above must be submitted to the Commission with a \\ncertification that the rule or rule amendment complies with the CEA and \\nCommission Regulations under the procedures specified in Sec.  40.6.\\n    The Commission received no comments on Sec.  49.8. Based on its \\nreview of the proposed regulation and the absence of comments, the \\nCommission is adopting Sec.  49.8 as proposed.\\n\\nIII. Effectiveness and Transition Period\\n\\n    Consistent with section 754 of the Dodd-Frank Act, part 49 of the \\nCommission\\'s Regulations will be effective on October 31, 2011 \\n(``Effective Date\\'\\'). Once part 49 is effective, the Commission will \\naccept applications to register as an SDR on new Form SDR adopted by \\nthe Commission in this Adopting Release.\\\\314\\\\ As explained below and as \\nnoted elsewhere in this Adopting Release, the compliance date for \\nvarious regulatory requirements is contingent upon the adoption and \\neffectiveness of other, related, regulatory provisions and definitions. \\nBecause the Commission believes that the suite of rules implementing \\nthe Dodd-Frank Act are complex and interconnected, it has determined \\nthat implementation can best be accomplished through a separate \\nrulemaking. The Commission expects in this separate rulemaking to \\nestablish an implementation and phase-in plan for\\n\\n[[Page 54572]]\\n\\nthe numerous rulemakings related to the Dodd-Frank Act.\\\\315\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\314\\\\ The Commission notes that although it is unable to mandate \\nregistration as an SDR prior to the effective date of the swap \\ndefinition rulemaking, SDRs can file applications with, and be \\ngranted approval, on a provisional basis, prior to that date. See \\nCommission and SEC, Notice of Proposed Joint Rulemaking: Further \\nDefinition of ``Swap,\\'\\' ``Security-Based Swap,\\'\\' and ``Security-\\nBased Swap Agreement;\\'\\' Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement \\nRecordkeeping, 76 FR 29818 (May 23, 2011). Authority for \\nregistration in advance of an effective date is provided in section \\n712(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 15 U.S.C. 8302(f).\\n    \\\\315\\\\ In connection with the SDR Rulemaking, the Commission \\nreceived fourteen comments that directly relate to implementation \\nand phase-in. These comments resulted from the Commission re-opening \\nof the comment period for several rulemakings, including the SDR \\nRulemaking, and a request for comment on the order in which it \\nshould consider final rulemakings made under the Dodd-Frank Act. See \\nCommission, Reopening and Extension of Comment Periods for \\nRulemakings Implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \\nConsumer Protection Act, 76 FR 25274 (May 4, 2011). Comments \\naddressing implementation and phase-in were received from: (1) \\nWorking Group of Commercial Energy Firms (``WGCEF\\'\\') on March 23, \\n2011; (2) CME on March 23, 2011; (3) Financial Services Roundtable \\non April 6, 2011; (4) Financial Services Forum, Futures Industry \\nAssociation, International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the \\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association on May 4, \\n2011; (5) Financial Services Roundtable, on May 12, 2011; (6) Swaps \\n& Derivatives Market Association on June 1, 2011; (7) AII on June 2, \\n2011; (8) Wholesale Markets Brokers\\' Association Americas on June 3, \\n2011; (9) Encana on June 7, 2011; (10) Chris Barnard on June 8, \\n2011; (11) Alternative Investment Management Association on June 10, \\n2011; (12) Futures Industry Association, Institute of International \\nBankers, International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Investment \\nCompany Institute, Securities Industry and Financial Markets \\nAssociation, U.S. Chamber of Commerce on June 10, 2011; (13) AII on \\nJune 10, 2011; and (14) MarkitSERV on June 10, 2011.

The Commission believes that the adoption of registration \\nrequirements (including a provisional registration) and applicable \\nstatutory duties and core principles does not itself necessitate a \\ndelayed compliance date with part 49 for registered SDRs. In \\nparticular, the adoption of the provisional registration process set \\nforth in Sec.  49.3(b) should provide SDR applicants with sufficient \\ntime to fully comply with part 49 while at the same time permitting \\nthose SDR that are operational to function. Entities that currently \\noperate in a manner similar to an SDR and seek to be registered under \\npart 49 will require operational and systems changes in order to comply \\nwith part 49. For those entities that do not currently operate as a \\nrepository or in a similar capacity, the Commission believes that \\nsignificant operational and technology resources would be required in \\norder for such entities to register and comply with part 49.\\n    The Commission notes that SDRs will not otherwise be fully \\noperational as of the effective date of part 49 but instead will \\nrequire an implementation or compliance period based on requirements \\nfor reporting swap transaction data as well as the real-time \\ndissemination of swap data that are the subject of separate rulemakings \\nby the Commission.\\\\316\\\\ In both the Data and Real-Time Rulemakings, a \\ndelayed effectiveness date or compliance date is likely given the \\ncomplexities and technology changes that must be implemented on an \\nindustry-wide basis.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\316\\\\ See Data NRPM and Real-Time NPRM supra notes 6 and 28, \\nrespectively.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIV. Related Matters\\n\\nA. Paperwork Reduction Act\\n\\n    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required \\nto respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a \\ncurrently valid control number issued by the Office of Management and \\nBudget (``OMB\\'\\'). The final part 49 rules result in information \\ncollection requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction \\nAct of 1995 (``PRA\\'\\').\\\\317\\\\ The Commission submitted its proposing \\nrelease and supporting documentation to OMB for review in accordance \\nwith 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. The Commission requested that \\nOMB approve, and assign a new control number for, the collections of \\ninformation covered by the proposing release. The information \\ncollection burdens created by the Commission\\'s proposed rules, which \\nwere discussed in detail in the proposing release,\\\\318\\\\ are identical \\nto the collective information collection burdens of the final rules.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\317\\\\ 44 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.\\n    \\\\318\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80923-80925.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission invited the public and other Federal agencies to \\ncomment on any aspect of the information collection requirements \\ndiscussed in the NPRM.\\\\319\\\\ Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), the \\nCommission solicited comments in order to: (i) Evaluate whether the \\nproposed collections of information were necessary for the proper \\nperformance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the \\ninformation will have practical utility; (ii) evaluate the accuracy of \\nthe Commission\\'s estimates of the burden of the proposed collections of \\ninformation; (iii) determine whether there are ways to enhance the \\nquality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected; and \\n(iv) minimize the burden of the collections of information on those who \\nare to respond, including through the use of automated collection \\ntechniques or other forms of information technology. The Commission \\nreceived no comment on its burden estimates or on any other aspect of \\nthe information collection requirements contained in its proposing \\nrelease.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\319\\\\ Id. at 80925.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The title for the collection of information under part 49 is ``Swap \\nData Repositories Registration and Regulatory Requirements.\\'\\' OMB has \\napproved and assigned OMB control number 3038-0086 to this collection \\nof information.\\n\\nB. Cost-Benefit Considerations\\n\\n    Section 15(a) of the CEA explicitly requires the Commission to \\nconsider the costs and benefits of its actions before promulgating a \\nregulation under the CEA. In particular, costs and benefits must be \\nevaluated in light of five broad areas of market and public concern: \\n(1) Protection of market participants and the public; (2) efficiency, \\ncompetitiveness and financial integrity of futures markets; (3) price \\ndiscovery; (4) sound risk management practices; and (5) other public \\ninterest considerations. The Commission may, in its discretion, give \\ngreater weight to any one of the five enumerated areas depending upon \\nthe nature of the regulatory action.\\n    Section 728 of the Dodd-Frank Act provides the Commission with \\nauthority to adopt and implement rules and regulations regarding the \\nregistration and regulation of SDRs. Pursuant to that authority the \\nCommission proposed the adoption of new part 49 to the Commission\\'s \\nregulations to require persons that meet the definition of an SDR to \\nregister and comply with specific duties and core principles enumerated \\nin section 21 as well as other requirements that the Commission may \\nprescribe by regulation. In particular, the Commission proposed to (1) \\ncreate a new part 49 of its regulations for the registration and \\nregulation of SDRs and (2) the adoption of a new form, Form SDR, to \\nregister as an SDR with the Commission.\\n    The cost-benefit discussion in the proposing release \\\\320\\\\ analyzed \\nthe costs and benefits of adopting new part 49 to the market generally \\nand to the limited number of potential entities expected to register as \\nSDRs. Specifically, the Commission determined that the proposed \\nregulations would benefit market participants and the public by \\nimproving transparency in the swaps market and fostering competition in \\nthe data and trade repository industries. In addition, by providing \\nregulators with access to the data maintained by SDRs, the Commission \\nbelieved that its proposal would promote greater risk management and \\ngive global regulators a better measure of systematic risk\\n\\n[[Page 54573]]\\n\\nthroughout the financial markets.\\\\321\\\\ The Commission stated in the SDR \\nNPRM that the failure to enact proposed part 49 regulations would be a \\ncost measured by the absence of transparency in the swaps market. This \\ndetermination was based on the belief that costs would appear as a \\nresult of market inefficiencies related to price discovery and risk \\nmanagement and the inability of regulators to properly monitor systemic \\nrisk.\\\\322\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\320\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80925.\\n    \\\\321\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\322\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission has considered the costs and benefits of the final \\nregulations pursuant to section 15(a) of the Act. The Commission has \\nconsidered the public comments received regarding costs and benefits in \\nresponse to the SDR NPRM. A discussion of the final regulations in \\nlight of section 15(a) factors is set out immediately below, followed \\nby a discussion of comments on cost-benefit considerations received in \\nresponse to the SDR NRPM.\\n1. Protection of Market Participants and the Public\\n    The Commission believes that the registration and regulation of \\nSDRs under part 49 of the Commission\\'s Regulations will serve to better \\nprotect market participants by providing the Commission and other \\nregulators with important oversight tools to monitor, measure, and \\ncomprehend the swaps markets. It is expected that the Commission\\'s \\nsurveillance and enforcement capabilities will accordingly be enhanced \\nby the adoption of part 49. In addition, the greater transparency to be \\nfurnished by mandated reporting to SDRs will also better improve the \\nmanagement of systemic risk throughout the financial markets by the \\nCommission as well as the FSOC and OFR.\\n    The Commission has estimated that the initial start up cost for the \\nestimated 15 SDR registrants to become registered under part 49 is \\nbetween $105.5 and $135.5 million, including between $60 and $90 \\nmillion for initial technological capital costs.\\\\323\\\\ Ongoing \\noperations are estimated to be between $47.07 and $77.072 million \\nannually for all SDRs, which includes between $30 and $60 million \\ndedicated to ongoing annual technological costs.\\\\324\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\323\\\\ These estimates were provided to the Office of Management \\nand Budget in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 \\n(``PRA\\'\\'), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The estimates were arrived at by \\nconsidering the document entitled ``Possible Role for NFA as a \\nUtility for Swap Transactions,\\'\\' which appears on the NFA Web site \\nat <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public@swaps/documents/file/derivative13sub083110-nfa.pdf\">http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public@swaps/documents/file/derivative13sub083110-nfa.pdf</a>. These estimates do not include \\npersonnel costs. Because the Commission has not regulated the swap \\nmarket, it has not previously collected data on actual costs. \\nAccordingly, the Commission solicited comment on any aspect of the \\nreporting and recordkeeping burdens associated with the proposed \\nrules, including the accuracy of the Commission\\'s estimates of the \\nburdens, in connection with OMB\\'s review of the proposed rules and \\nthe attendant information collections. See SDR NPRM supra note 8 at \\n80925. No comments were received. The Commission\\'s submissions to \\nOMB, including supporting documentation, may be obtained by visiting \\nthe Web site <a href=\"RegInfo.gov\">RegInfo.gov</a>.\\n    \\\\324\\\\ This estimate was obtained in consultation with the \\nCommission\\'s IT staff.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission is unable to estimate accurately the cost of \\nrecordkeeping given existing technologies, the current state of the \\nswaps market and the potential growth in the future. The difficulty in \\nestimating future and ongoing costs for SDRs is significantly related \\nto the range of duties that can vary by asset class as well as the \\nprobability that SDR responsibilities will increase and change over \\ntime.\\n2. Efficiency, Competitiveness, and Financial Integrity of Futures \\nMarkets\\n    The Commission believes that the adoption of the SDR regulation set \\nforth in part 49 together with the swap data recordkeeping and \\nreporting requirements proposed in part 45 will provide a robust source \\nof information on activities in the swaps market that is expected to \\npromote increased efficiency and competition. To date, the swaps market \\ngenerally has been characterized by a lack of transparency with a \\nselect number of dealers dominating the business. Although dealers will \\nlikely continue to have a significant presence in the swaps market, the \\ntransparency that is envisioned in the Dodd-Frank Act and thereby \\nimplemented by part 49 is expected to provide enhanced competition for \\nservices, and accordingly, lead to greater efficiencies for market \\nparticipants executing swap transactions.\\n    In addition, greater transparency for the Commission and other \\nregulators will provide better oversight of the swaps market and its \\nvarious market participants. Specifically, based on Sec.  49.17, SDRs \\nwill provide transaction data, including price points and counterparty \\nmatches, to a host of regulatory agencies (including the Commission) \\nproviding regulators additional tools for various surveillance and \\nenforcement programs. This type of transparency is currently \\nunavailable to regulators monitoring the swaps market. In addition, \\nempirical data obtained from SDRs will also be employed by the \\nCommission and other regulatory agencies to further study the behavior \\nof the swaps market.\\n    The Commission also believes that the introduction of SDRs will \\nfurther automate the execution and reporting of swap transactions. This \\nis likely to benefit market participants and reduce transactional risks \\nthrough SDRs and related service providers offering important ancillary \\nservices such as confirmation and matching services, valuations, \\npricing, reconciliation functions, position limits management, dispute \\nresolution and counterparty identification. The ability of regulators \\nto access the swap data maintained by SDRs will assist regulators to, \\namong other things, monitor risk exposures of individual counterparties \\nto swap transactions, monitor concentrations of risk exposure, and \\nevaluate systemic risk. In addition, the ability of DCOs to also \\nregister as SDRs will help regulators better identify the significant \\nparticipants in the swap market and better assess their financial \\nexposures.\\n    The Commission believes that the ``cost\\'\\' of the ``public\\'\\' or \\nregulatory function of an SDR could potentially conflict with its \\ncommercial interests. This is especially true for those SDRs that seek \\nregistration that are privately-owned and managed. As a result, the \\nCommission in adopting Sec.  49.17(g) and Sec.  49.21 has sought to \\nidentify various conflicts inherent in SDR operations with the \\nexpectation that these conflicts be minimized to the greatest extent \\npossible.\\n    The Commission notes that SDRs could potentially commercialize the \\nswap transactional data that is reported to it through relationships \\nand alliances with various market data vendors and similar firms. \\nMoreover, the disclosure of certain proprietary swap data potentially \\ncould compromise the submitters\\' intellectual property rights or \\nproprietary interests--for example, investment strategies, technology \\nsystems and algorithmic trading systems. The Commission has attempted \\nto minimize this possibility through the adoption of Sec.  49.17(g) \\nwhich prohibits the commercial use of data by SDRs unless consented to \\nby the reporting party. The Commission believes that ancillary services \\nprovided by SDRs or related entities may also create incentives for \\nSDRs to further promote such ancillary services. This conflict could be \\nmanifested in the manner in which swaps are required to be reported and \\nthrough various legal provisions in user agreements between the SDR and \\nreporting party.\\n    In the Commission\\'s view, fees charged by SDRs for reporting and \\nstorage of data will depend upon a\\n\\n[[Page 54574]]\\n\\nnumber of factors including, but not limited to, the (1) SDR\\'s cost \\nstructure; (2) availability of competitors; and (3) regulatory \\noversight of fees. A variety of different business models could develop \\nwhereby the reporting and storage of data to the SDR is but one facet \\nof the SDR\\'s operations with various ancillary services taking on \\ngreater importance.\\n    Because of the global nature of the swaps market, ``regulatory \\narbitrage\\'\\' could occur in connection with the reporting of swap data \\nto an SDR or repository if there are significant differences in the \\nregulatory regimes in the U.S. and abroad. In such a scenario, SDs \\ncould find it advantageous to report their trades to a foreign-based \\nrepository that is not subject to the stringent requirements embodied \\nin the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission and other regulators globally \\nhave been working to reduce the instances of regulatory arbitrage that \\nmay occur in connection with the regulation of the swaps markets. In \\nparticular, regulators have focused on SDRs and the reporting of swaps \\nas an area that should be relatively consistent or uniform worldwide. \\nThe Commission continues to work with other regulators to coordinate \\nand harmonize laws and regulations relating to SDRs or repositories.\\n3. Price Discovery\\n    The Commission believes that part 49, together with such Dodd-Frank \\nAct requirements as mandatory clearing and trading, will promote \\ngreater price efficiency and increased competition for swaps and other \\nrelated financial instruments. Part 49\\'s provisions relating to \\nregulator access will permit the Commission, other domestic regulators \\nand foreign regulators to examine potential price discrepancies and \\nother trading inconsistencies in the swaps market.\\n    The Commission notes that requirements set forth in Sec.  49.13, \\nrelating to an SDR\\'s obligation to confirm the accuracy of reported \\ndata, will create additional cost burdens for SDRs that may marginally \\nincrease based on the scope and volume of data transmitted. In adopting \\nSec.  49.13, the Commission recognizes the potential cost burdens of \\nthis regulation based on section 21(c)(2) of the CEA, and has sought to \\nreduce the effect on SDRs by permitting an SDR to rely on the accuracy \\nof reported data if submitted by an electronic matching/confirmation \\nplatform.\\n    Where there are multiple SDRs for a particular asset class, the \\nCommission is concerned that swap data may be vulnerable to \\nfragmentation due to the potential for swaps in such an asset class to \\nbe reported to more than one SDR. In addition, the Commission submits \\nthat permitting a DCO acting as an SDR to limit its reporting to \\n``cleared\\'\\' swap transactions would further fragment data \\nreporting.\\\\325\\\\ The Commission also notes that if SDR regulations \\nadopted by the Commission and the SEC significantly diverge, SDRs and \\nmarket participants would accordingly be subject to potentially higher \\nfees and charges because of conflicting and/or duplicative \\nrequirements.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\325\\\\ See CL-CME supra note 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n4. Sound Risk Management Practices\\n    The Commission believes that part 49 and related part 45, which \\naddresses the reporting and recordkeeping of swap transactions by all \\nmarket participants, will greatly strengthen the risk management \\npractices of the swap industry. Prior to this time, participants in the \\nswaps markets have operated largely unregulated and without obligation \\nto disclose transactions to regulators and/or the public. The Dodd-\\nFrank Act specifically changed the transparency of the swaps market \\nwith the adoption of section 21 of the CEA and the establishment of \\nSDRs as the entity to which swap transaction data will be reported and \\nmaintained for the use of regulators. The Commission believes that the \\nreporting of all swap transactions to an SDR will serve to improve risk \\nmanagement practices by market participants through better knowledge of \\nopen positions and SDR services related to various trade, collateral, \\nand risk management practices that are likely to be offered. The \\nCommission notes that total transaction costs incurred by market \\nparticipants will invariably increase as a result of additional \\nreporting and business conduct obligations.\\n    As adopted, Sec.  49.17 (c) provides the Commission with direct \\nelectronic access to SDR data on a real-time basis. This access will \\nenable the Commission to better monitor the swap market and promptly \\nreact to potential market emergencies from unreasonable risks and \\nexposures. In addition, the requirement that SDRs have in place a CCO--\\nmandated by section 21(e) of the CEA and implemented in Sec.  49.22--\\nwill further support the importance of risk management and proper \\nconflict of interest management going forward.\\n    Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, part 49 provides that swap data \\nreported and maintained by SDRs will be made available to both U.S. and \\nforeign regulators in an effort to increase global transparency and \\nreduce systemic risk. Because of the global and international aspects \\nof the swaps market, the Commission has sought, to the extent possible, \\nto coordinate and cooperate with foreign regulators in order to \\nfacilitate access to swap data.\\n    To ensure that swap data will not impermissibly be disclosed or \\nbreached, potentially subjecting SDRs and the Commission to litigation \\nrisks and expenses, the Dodd-Frank Act in section 21(d) of the CEA \\nmandated that domestic and foreign regulators (except for Supervisory \\nAppropriate Foreign Regulators) must execute a confidentiality and \\nindemnification agreement with the SDR prior to receiving access to SDR \\ninformation. Section 49.18, implementing section 21(d) of the CEA, \\nprovides that other domestic and foreign regulators must comply with \\nthe confidentiality requirements set forth in section 8 of the CEA \\nrelating to the swap data that is to be provided by the registered SDR. \\nThis confidentiality and indemnification agreement would require the \\nregulator to indemnify the SDR and the Commission for any expenses \\narising from litigation relating to the information provided under \\nsection 8 of the CEA. The Commission received a comment regarding \\naccess to SDR data by foreign regulators that raised concerns with \\nrespect to confidentiality and the role of the Commission as a \\ngatekeeper.\\\\326\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\326\\\\ See CL-MFA supra note 51 at 3-4. MFA urged that the \\nCommission actively participate in verifying the validity of access \\nrequests by foreign regulators. The Commission believes it is \\ninappropriate to place unnecessary burdens on foreign regulators\\' \\naccess to swap data held by U.S. SDRs. The confidentiality and \\nindemnification agreement required to be executed between the SDR \\nand foreign regulators, as well as any memorandum of understanding \\nMOU between the Commission and foreign regulators, should ensure \\nthat data is accessed appropriately and maintained confidentially.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission believes that regulator access (both domestic and \\nforeign) to the data held by an SDR is essential for appropriate risk \\nmanagement to be performed by regulators. This is especially important \\nfor regulators to be able to monitor the swap market and certain \\nparticipants relating to systemic risk.\\n5. Other Public Interest Considerations\\n    The Commission believes that increased transparency resulting from \\nthe data collected from SDRs will facilitate greater understanding of \\nhow the swaps market interacts with and affects financial markets and \\nthe overall economy. Increased transparency and disclosure through SDRs \\nto various\\n\\n[[Page 54575]]\\n\\nregulators will support oversight and enforcement efforts and \\ncapabilities. In addition, empirical data that will be provided to the \\nCommission from SDRs in all asset classes should provide the \\nCommission, legislators and the public with a better understanding of \\nthe market, thereby producing more effective public policy to reduce \\noverall systemic risk.\\n    The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations such as part 49 \\nwill likely have extraterritorial effects because of the global nature \\nof the swaps market and market participant operations. Consequently, \\nthe Commission is cognizant of the potential for part 49 to overlap \\nwith foreign regulations with respect to repositories or SDRs that also \\noperate in foreign jurisdictions. Duplicative or overlapping \\nregulations would potentially burden SDRs and firms that operate \\nglobally. The Commission in implementing part 49 expects to rely on \\nforeign regulators and regulations to the extent possible consistent \\nwith the Dodd-Frank Act. However, section 4(c) of the CEA, as amended \\nby the Dodd-Frank Act, severely limits the Commission\\'s ability to \\naccommodate SDRs because of the prohibition against providing any \\nexemptive relief under section 21.\\n    Pursuant to section 2(a)(13)(G) and proposed part 43 of the \\nCommission\\'s regulations, the Commission expects SDRs to play a \\nsignificant role in the public dissemination of swap data. Because it \\nis likely that SDRs will assume a major role in the real time \\ndissemination of swap data, SDRs may incur greater costs in the \\ndevelopment of increased technology and operational resources. The \\nCommission is unable presently to quantify those costs; they will be \\naddressed in the context of the part 43 rules.\\n6. Comments\\n    In the SDR NPRM, the Commission solicited comment on its \\nconsideration of these costs and benefits. The Commission received two \\ncomments with respect to the cost benefit analysis in the SDR \\nNPRM.\\\\327\\\\ In addition, several market participants commented more \\ngenerally that the registration procedures as proposed by the \\nCommission in part 49 are burdensome and could be revised to reduce the \\nburden on applicants for registration.\\\\328\\\\ CME Group asserted that the \\nCommission\\'s primary focus in implementing the Dodd-Frank Act should be \\non the least costly, least burdensome and most efficient alternatives \\navailable. In that regard, CME suggested that DCOs that are also SDRs \\ncan achieve compliance with SDR core principles by demonstrating \\ncompliance with analogous DCO core principles. By the same token, CME \\nurges that the Commission offer registration relief to DCOs wishing to \\nregister as SDRs in order to reduce the burden of filing duplicative \\nmaterials. After careful consideration, the Commission has concluded, \\nfirst, that the burden of filing duplicative materials is limited to \\nthe costs of providing these materials electronically. Second, with \\nrespect to core principle compliance, where a particular DCO core \\nprinciple is identical in its requirements to an SDR core principle, \\nthe Commission believes that compliance with the latter could be \\ndemonstrated by compliance with the former. Potential non-U.S. SDRs \\nexpressed concern with respect to the burden of registering in multiple \\ncountries or jurisdictions. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit \\nexceptions to its registration requirements; however, as noted above in \\nthe discussion related to registration, the Commission is undertaking \\nto work cooperatively with foreign regulators toward establishing, \\nwhere appropriate, a form of recognition regime to partly alleviate the \\nperceived burden.\\\\329\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\327\\\\ CL-CME and CL-NFPE Coalition supra note 51.\\n    \\\\328\\\\ See CL-CME, CL-Foreign Banks, CL-TriOptima, CL-Regis-TR \\nand CL-DTCC I supra note 51. These comments are discussed above in \\nconnection with the Commission\\'s registration procedures set forth \\nin Sec.  49.3.\\n    \\\\329\\\\ See CL-NFPE Coalition supra note 51. As a separate matter, \\nthe NFPE Coalition highlighted what it views as the potential \\nincreased burden on end-users who employ swaps to hedge against \\ncommercial risk. The NFPE Coalition expressed concern that non-\\nfinancial entities would be treated in a substantially similar \\nmanner as swap dealers or financial services firms, thereby \\nunnecessarily increasing the burdens on such non-financial entities. \\nThe Commission believes that these concerns are more properly \\naddressed in the Data and Real-Time Reporting rulemakings. See Data \\nNPRM supra note 6 and Real-Time NPRM supra note 28.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Consistent with section 15(a) of the CEA, the Commission believes \\nthat part 49 as adopted is in the public interest and will further \\nprotect participants and the public, promote efficiency, competition \\nand the financial integrity of financial markets, promote accurate and \\nefficient price discovery, enhance sound risk management practices and \\naddress other public interest considerations such as access to SDR data \\nby other domestic and foreign regulators.\\n\\nC. Regulatory Flexibility Act\\n\\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA\\'\\'), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., \\nrequires that agencies consider the impact of their rules on small \\nbusinesses. The Commission noted in the proposing release that although \\nit has established certain definitions of ``small entity\\'\\' to be used \\nin evaluating the impact of its rules under the RFA,\\\\330\\\\ it had not \\npreviously addressed the question of whether SDRs are small entities \\nfor purposes of the RFA. For the reasons set forth in the proposing \\nrelease, the Commission determined that, similar to DCOs and DCMs, SDRs \\nare not ``small entities\\'\\' for purposes of the RFA. Accordingly, the \\nChairman, on behalf of the Commission, certified in the NPRM pursuant \\nto 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the actions to be taken herein will not have a \\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small \\nentities.\\\\331\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\330\\\\ The Commission previously has established that, because of \\nthe central role they play in the regulatory scheme concerning \\nfutures trading, the importance of futures trading in the national \\neconomy, and the stringent requirements of the CEA, DCOs and DCMs \\nare not small entities. See SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80926.\\n    \\\\331\\\\ SDR NPRM supra note 8 at 80926.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nV.

(1) An applicant, person or entity \\ndesiring to be registered as a swap data repository shall file \\nelectronically an application for registration on Form SDR provided in \\nappendix A to this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its \\nheadquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified \\nby the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with the instructions \\ncontained therein.\\n    (2) The application shall include information sufficient to \\ndemonstrate compliance with core principles specified in Section 21 of \\nthe Act and the regulations thereunder. Form SDR consists of \\ninstructions, general questions and a list of Exhibits (documents, \\ninformation and evidence) required by the Commission in order to \\ndetermine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core \\nprinciples. An application will not be considered to be materially \\ncomplete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits \\nas required in Form SDR. If the application is not materially complete, \\nthe Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not \\nbe deemed to have been submitted for purposes of the 180-day review \\nprocedures.\\n    (3) 180-Day Review Procedures. The Commission will review the \\napplication for registration as a swap data repository within 180 days \\nof the date of the filing of such application. In considering an \\napplication for registration as a swap data repository, the staff of \\nthe Commission shall include in its review, an applicant\\'s past \\nrelevant submissions and compliance history. At or prior to\\n\\n[[Page 54577]]\\n\\nthe conclusion of the 180-day period, the Commission will either by \\norder grant registration; extend, by order, the 180-day review period \\nfor good cause; or deny the application for registration as a swap data \\nrepository. The 180-day review period shall commence once a completed \\nsubmission on Form SDR is submitted to the Commission. The \\ndetermination of when such submission on Form SDR is complete shall be \\nat the sole discretion of the Commission. If deemed appropriate, the \\nCommission may grant registration as a swap data repository subject to \\nconditions. If the Commission denies an application for registration as \\na swap data repository, it shall specify the grounds for such denial. \\nIn the event of a denial of registration for a swap data repository, \\nany person so denied shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing \\nbefore the Commission.\\n    (4) Standard for Approval. The Commission shall grant the \\nregistration of a swap data repository if the Commission finds that \\nsuch swap data repository is appropriately organized, and has the \\ncapacity: to ensure the prompt, accurate and reliable performance of \\nits functions as a swap data repository; comply with any applicable \\nprovisions of the Act and regulations thereunder; carry out its \\nfunctions in a manner consistent with the purposes of Section 21 of the \\nAct and the regulations thereunder; and operate in a fair, equitable \\nand consistent manner. The Commission shall deny registration of a swap \\ndata repository if it appears that the application is materially \\nincomplete; fails in form or substance to meet the requirements of \\nSection 21 of the Act and part 49; or is amended or supplemented in a \\nmanner that is inconsistent with this Sec.  49.3. The Commission shall \\nnotify the applicant seeking registration that the Commission is \\ndenying the application setting forth the deficiencies in the \\napplication, and/or the manner in which the application fails to meet \\nthe requirements of this part.\\n    (5) Amendments and Annual Filing. If any information reported on \\nForm SDR or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any \\nreason, whether before or after the application for registration has \\nbeen granted, the swap data repository shall promptly file an amendment \\non Form SDR updating such information. In addition, the swap data \\nrepository shall annually file an amendment on Form SDR within 60 days \\nafter the end of each fiscal year.\\n    (6) Service of Process. Each swap data repository shall designate \\nand authorize on Form SDR an agent in the United States, other than a \\nCommission official, who shall accept any notice or service of process, \\npleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings brought \\nagainst the swap data repository to enforce the Act and the regulations \\nthereunder.\\n    (b) Provisional Registration. The Commission, upon the request of \\nan applicant, may grant provisional registration of a swap data \\nrepository if such applicant is in substantial compliance with the \\nstandards set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and is able to \\ndemonstrate operational capability, real-time processing, multiple \\nredundancy and robust security controls. Such provisional registration \\nof a swap data repository shall expire on the earlier of: the date that \\nthe Commission grants or denies registration of the swap data \\nrepository; or the date that the Commission rescinds the temporary \\nregistration of the swap data repository. This paragraph (b) shall \\nterminate within such time as determined by the Commission. A \\nprovisional registration granted by the Commission does not affect the \\nright of the Commission to grant or deny permanent registration as \\nprovided under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.\\n    (c) Withdrawal of Application for Registration. An applicant for \\nregistration may withdraw its application submitted pursuant to \\nparagraph (a) of this section by filing with the Commission such a \\nrequest. Withdrawal of an application for registration shall not affect \\nany action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, \\nactivities, or events occurring during the time that the application \\nfor registration was pending with the Commission, and shall not \\nprejudice the filing of a new application by such applicant.\\n    (d) Reinstatement of Dormant Registration. Before accepting or re-\\naccepting swap transaction data, a dormant registered swap data \\nrepository as defined in Sec.  40.1(e) of this chapter shall reinstate \\nits registration under the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of \\nthis section; provided, however, that an application for reinstatement \\nmay rely upon previously submitted materials that still pertain to, and \\naccurately describe, current conditions.\\n    (e) Delegation of Authority. (1) The Commission hereby delegates, \\nuntil it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market \\nOversight or the Director\\'s delegates, with the consultation of the \\nGeneral Counsel or the General Counsel\\'s delegates, the authority to \\nnotify an applicant seeking registration as a swap data repository \\npursuant to Section 21 of the Act that the application is materially \\nincomplete and the 180-day period review period is extended.\\n    (2) The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to \\nthe Commission for its consideration any matter which has been \\ndelegated in this paragraph.\\n    (3) Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its \\nelection, from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (e)(1) \\nof this section.\\n    (f) Request for Confidential Treatment. An applicant for \\nregistration may request confidential treatment for materials submitted \\nin its application as set forth in Sec. Sec.  40.8 and 145.9 of this \\nchapter. The applicant shall identify with particularity information in \\nthe application that will be subject to a request for confidential \\ntreatment.\\n\\n\\nSec.  49.4  Withdrawal from registration.\\n\\n    (a)(1) A registered swap data repository may withdraw its \\nregistration by giving notice in writing to the Commission requesting \\nthat its registration as a swap data repository be withdrawn, which \\nnotice shall be served at least sixty days prior to the date named \\ntherein as the date when the withdrawal of registration shall take \\neffect. The request to withdraw shall be made by a person duly \\nauthorized by the registrant and shall specify:\\n    (i) The name of the registrant for which withdrawal of registration \\nis being requested;\\n    (ii) The name, address and telephone number of the swap data \\nrepository that will have custody of data and records of the \\nregistrant;\\n    (iii) The address where such data and records will be located; and\\n    (iv) A statement that the custodial swap data repository is \\nauthorized to make such data and records available in accordance with \\nSec.  1.44.\\n    (2) Prior to filing a request to withdraw, a registered swap data \\nrepository shall file an amended Form SDR to update any inaccurate \\ninformation. A withdrawal of registration shall not affect any action \\ntaken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities \\nor events occurring during the time that the facility was designated by \\nthe Commission.\\n    (b) A notice of withdrawal from registration filed by a swap data \\nrepository shall become effective for all matters (except as provided \\nin this paragraph (b)) on the 60th day after the filing thereof with \\nthe Commission, within such longer period of time as to which such swap \\ndata repository\\n\\n[[Page 54578]]\\n\\nconsents or which the Commission, by order, may determine as necessary \\nor appropriate in the public interest.\\n    (c) Revocation of Registration for False Application. If, after \\nnotice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that any \\nregistered swap data repository has obtained its registration by making \\nany false or misleading statements with respect to any material fact or \\nhas violated or failed to comply with any provision of the Act and \\nregulations thereunder, the Commission, by order, may revoke the \\nregistration. Pending final determination whether any registration \\nshall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such \\nregistration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after \\nnotice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate and \\nin the public interest.\\n\\n\\nSec.  49.5  Equity interest transfers.\\n\\n    (a) Equity transfer notification. Upon entering into any \\nagreement(s) that could result in an equity interest transfer of ten \\npercent or more in the swap data repository, the swap data repository \\nshall file a notification of the equity interest transfer with the \\nSecretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, DC in a \\nformat and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, \\nno later than the business day, as defined in Sec.  40.1 of this \\nchapter, following the date on which the swap data repository enters \\ninto a firm obligation to transfer the equity interest. The swap data \\nrepository shall also amend any information that is no longer accurate \\non Form SDR consistent with the procedures set forth in Sec.  49.3 of \\nthis part.\\n    (b) Required information. The notification must include and be \\naccompanied by: any relevant agreement(s), including any preliminary \\nagreements; any associated changes to relevant corporate documents; a \\nchart outlining any new ownership or corporate or organizational \\nstructure; a brief description of the purpose and any impact of the \\nequity interest transfer; and a representation from the swap data \\nrepository that it meets all of the requirements of Section 21 of the \\nAct and Commission regulations adopted thereunder. The swap data \\nrepository shall keep the Commission apprised of the projected date \\nthat the transaction resulting in the equity interest transfer will be \\nconsummated, and must provide to the Commission any new agreements or \\nmodifications to the original agreement(s) filed pursuant to this \\nsection. The swap data repository shall notify the Commission of the \\nconsummation of the transaction on the day in which it occurs.\\n    (c) Certification. (1) Upon a transfer of an equity interest of ten \\npercent or more in a registered swap data repository, the registered \\nswap data repository shall file with the Secretary of the Commission at \\nits headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner \\nspecified by the Secretary of the Commission, a certification that the \\nregistered swap data repository meets all of the requirements of \\nSection 21 of the Act and Commission regulations adopted thereunder, no \\nlater than two business days, as defined in Sec.  40.1 of this chapter, \\nfollowing the date on which the equity interest of ten percent or more \\nwas acquired. Such certification shall state whether changes to any \\naspects of the swap data repository\\'s operations were made as a result \\nof such change in ownership, and include a description of any such \\nchange(s).\\n    (2) The certification required under this paragraph may rely on and \\nbe supported by reference to an application for registration as a swap \\ndata repository or prior filings made pursuant to a rule submission \\nrequirement, along with any necessary new filings, including new \\nfilings that provide any and all material updates of prior submissions.\\n\\n\\nSec.  49.6  Registration of successor entities.\\n\\n    (a) In the event of a corporate transaction, such as a re-\\norganization, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other similar \\ncorporate event, that creates a new entity, in which the swap data \\nrepository continues to operate, the swap data repository shall request \\na transfer of the registration, rules, and other matters, no later than \\n30 days after the succession. The registration of the predecessor shall \\nbe deemed to remain effective as the registration of the successor if \\nthe successor, within 30 days after such succession, files an \\napplication for registration on Form SDR, and the predecessor files a \\nrequest for vacation of registration on Form SDR provided, however, \\nthat the registration of the predecessor swap data repository shall \\ncease to be effective 90 days after the application for registration on \\nForm SDR is filed by the successor swap data repository.\\n    (b) If the succession is based solely on a change in the \\npredecessor\\'s date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or \\ncomposition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after \\nthe succession, amend the registration of the predecessor swap data \\nrepository on Form SDR to reflect these changes. This amendment shall \\nbe an application for registration filed by the predecessor and adopted \\nby the successor.\\n\\n\\nSec.  49.7  Swap data repositories located in foreign jurisdictions.\\n\\n    Any swap data repository located outside of the United States \\napplying for registration pursuant to Sec.  49.3 of this part shall \\ncertify on Form SDR and provide an opinion of counsel that the swap \\ndata repository, as a matter of law, is able to provide the Commission \\nwith prompt access to the books and records of such swap data \\nrepository and that the swap data repository can submit to onsite \\ninspection and examination by the Commission.\\n\\n\\nSec.  49.8  Procedures for implementing registered swap data repository \\nrules.\\n\\n    (a) Request for Commission approval of rules. An applicant for \\nregistration as a swap data repository may request that the Commission \\napprove under Section 5c(c) of the Act, any or all of its rules and \\nsubsequent amendments thereto, prior to their implementation or, \\nnotwithstanding the provisions of Section 5c(c)(2) of the Act, at \\nanytime thereafter, under the procedures of Sec.  40.5 of this chapter.\\n    (b) Notwithstanding the timeline under Sec.  40.5(c) of this \\nchapter, the rules of a swap data repository that have been submitted \\nfor Commission approval at the same time as an application for \\nregistration under Sec.  49.3 of this part or to reinstate the \\nregistration of a dormant registered swap data repository, as defined \\nin Sec.  40.1 of this chapter, will be deemed approved by the \\nCommission no earlier than when the swap data repository is deemed to \\nbe registered or reinstated.\\n    (c) Self-certification of rules. Rules of a registered swap data \\nrepository not voluntarily submitted for prior Commission approval \\npursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to the \\nCommission with a certification that the rule or rule amendment \\ncomplies with the Act or rules thereunder pursuant to the procedures of \\nSec.  40.6 of this chapter, as applicable.\\n\\n\\nSec.  49.9  Duties of registered swap data repositories.\\n\\n    (a) Duties. To be registered, and maintain registration, as a swap \\ndata repository, a registered swap data repository shall:\\n    (1) Accept swap data as prescribed in Sec.  49.10 for each swap;\\n    (2) Confirm, as prescribed in Sec.  49.11, with both counterparties \\nto the swap the accuracy of the swap data that was submitted;\\n    (3) Maintain, as prescribed in Sec.  49.12, the swap data described \\nin part 45 of the\\n\\n[[Page 54579]]\\n\\nCommission\\'s Regulations in such form and manner as provided therein \\nand in the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;\\n    (4) Provide direct electronic access to the Commission (or any \\ndesignee of the Commission, including another registered entity) as \\nprescribed in Sec.  49.17;\\n    (5) Provide the information set forth in Sec.  49.15 to comply with \\nthe public reporting requirements set forth in Section 2(a)(13) of the \\nAct;\\n    (6) Establish automated systems for monitoring, screening, and \\nanalyzing swap data as prescribed in Sec.  49.13;\\n    (7) Establish automated systems for monitoring, screening and \\nanalyzing end-user clearing exemption claims as prescribed in Sec.  \\n49.14;\\n    (8) Maintain the privacy of any and all swap data and any other \\nrelated information that the swap data repository receives from a \\nreporting entity as prescribed in Sec.  49.16;\\n    (9) Upon request of certain appropriate domestic and foreign \\nregulators, provide access to swap data and information held and \\nmaintained by the swap data repository as prescribed in Sec.  49.17;\\n    (10) Adopt and establish appropriate emergency policies and \\nprocedures, including business continuity and disaster recovery plans, \\nas prescribed in Sec.  49.23 and Sec.  49.24.\\n    (11) Designate an individual to serve as a chief compliance officer \\nwho shall comply with Sec.  49.22; and\\n    (12) Subject itself to inspection and examination by the \\nCommission.\\n    (b) This Regulation is not intended to limit, or restrict, the \\napplicability of other provisions of the Act, including, but not \\nlimited to, Section 2(a)(13) of the Act and rules and regulations \\npromulgated thereunder.\\n\\n\\nSec.  49.10  Acceptance of data.\\n\\n    (a) A registered swap data repository shall establish, maintain, \\nand enforce policies and procedures for the reporting of swap data to \\nthe registered swap data repository and shall accept and promptly \\nrecord all swap data in its selected asset class and other regulatory \\ninformation that is required to be reported pursuant to part 45 and \\npart 43 of this chapter by designated contract markets, derivatives \\nclearing organizations, swap execution facilities, swap dealers, major \\nswap participants and/or non-swap dealer/non-major swap participant \\ncounterparties.\\n    (1) Electronic Connectivity. For the purpose of accepting all swap \\ndata as required by part 45 and part 43, the registered swap data \\nrepository shall adopt policies and procedures, including technological \\nprotocols, which provide for electronic connectivity between the swap \\ndata repository and designated contract markets, derivatives clearing \\norganizations, swaps execution facilities, swap dealers, major swap \\nparticipants and/or certain other non-swap dealer/non-major swap \\nparticipant counterparties who report such data. The technological \\nprotocols established by a swap data repository shall provide for the \\nreceipt of swap creation data, swap continuation data, real-time public \\nreporting data, and all other data and information required to be \\nreported to such swap data repository.

The swap data repository shall keep records of the \\nresults of such tests, and make the results available to the Commission \\nupon request.\\n    (f) A registered swap data repository that is not determined by the \\nCommission to be a critical swap data repository satisfies the \\nrequirement to be able to resume operations and resume ongoing \\nfulfillment of the swap data repository\\'s duties and obligations during \\nthe next business day following a disruption by maintaining either:\\n    (1) Infrastructure and personnel resources of its own that are \\nsufficient to ensure timely recovery and resumption of its operations, \\nduties and obligations as a registered swap data repository following \\nany disruption of its operations; or\\n    (2) Contractual arrangements with other registered swap data \\nrepositories or disaster recovery service providers, as appropriate, \\nthat are sufficient to ensure continued fulfillment of all of the swap \\ndata repository\\'s duties and obligations following any disruption of \\nits operations, both with respect to all swaps reported to the swap \\ndata repository and with respect to all swap data contained in the swap \\ndata repository.\\n    (g) A registered swap data repository shall notify Commission staff \\npromptly of all:\\n    (1) Systems malfunctions;\\n    (2) Cyber security incidents or targeted threats that actually or \\npotentially jeopardize automated system operation, reliability, \\nsecurity, or capacity; and\\n    (3) Any activation of the swap data repository\\'s business \\ncontinuity-disaster recovery plan.\\n    (h) A registered swap data repository shall give Commission staff \\ntimely advance notice of all:\\n    (1) Planned changes to automated systems that may impact the \\nreliability, security, or adequate scalable capacity of such systems; \\nand\\n    (2) Planned changes to the swap data repository\\'s program of risk \\nanalysis and oversight.\\n    (i) A registered swap data repository shall provide to the \\nCommission upon request current copies of its business continuity and \\ndisaster recovery plan and other emergency procedures, its assessments \\nof its operational risks, and other documents requested by Commission \\nstaff for the purpose of maintaining a current profile of the swap data \\nrepository\\'s automated systems.\\n    (j) A registered swap data repository shall conduct regular, \\nperiodic, objective testing and review of its automated systems to \\nensure that they are reliable, secure, and have adequate scalable \\ncapacity. It shall also conduct regular, periodic testing and review of \\nits business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities. Both types of \\ntesting should be conducted by qualified, independent professionals. \\nSuch qualified independent professionals may be independent contractors \\nor employees of the swap data repository, but should not be persons \\nresponsible for development or operation of the systems or capabilities \\nbeing tested. Pursuant to Sec. Sec.  1.31, 49.12 and 45.2 of the \\nCommission\\'s Regulations, the swap data repository shall keep records \\nof all such tests, and make all test results available to the \\nCommission upon request.\\n    (k) To the extent practicable, a registered swap data repository \\nshould:\\n    (1) Coordinate its business continuity-disaster recovery plan with \\nthose of swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, \\nderivatives clearing organizations, swap dealers, and major swap \\nparticipants who report swap data to the swap data repository, and with \\nthose regulators identified in Section 21(c)(7) of the Act, in a manner \\nadequate to enable effective resumption of the registered swap data \\nrepository\\'s fulfillment of its duties and obligations following a \\ndisruption causing activation of the swap data repository\\'s business \\ncontinuity and disaster recovery plan;\\n    (2) Participate in periodic, synchronized testing of its business \\ncontinuity--disaster recovery plan and the business continuity--\\ndisaster recovery plans of swap execution facilities, designated \\ncontract markets, derivatives clearing organizations, swap dealers, and \\nmajor swap participants who report swap data to the registered swap \\ndata repository, and the business continuity--disaster recovery plans \\nrequired by the regulators identified in Section 21(c)(7) of the Act; \\nand\\n    (3) Ensure that its business continuity--disaster recovery plan \\ntakes into account the business continuity--disaster recovery plans of \\nits telecommunications, power, water, and other essential service \\nproviders.\\n\\n\\nSec.  49.25  Financial resources.\\n\\n    (a) General rule.

A registered \\nswap data repository shall, on a quarterly basis, based upon its fiscal \\nyear, make a reasonable calculation of its projected operating costs \\nover a 12-month period in order to determine the amount needed to meet \\nthe requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. The swap data \\nrepository shall have reasonable discretion in determining the \\nmethodology used to compute such projected operating costs. The \\nCommission may review the methodology and require changes as \\nappropriate.\\n    (d) Valuation of financial resources. At appropriate intervals, but \\nnot less than quarterly, a registered swap data repository shall \\ncompute the current market value of each financial resource used to \\nmeet its obligations under paragraph (a) of this section. Reductions in \\nvalue to reflect market and credit risk (haircuts) shall be applied as \\nappropriate.\\n    (e) Liquidity of financial resources. The financial resources \\nallocated by the registered swap data repository to meet the \\nrequirements of paragraph (a) shall include unencumbered, liquid \\nfinancial assets (i.e., cash and/or highly liquid securities) equal to \\nat least six months\\' operating costs. If any portion of such financial \\nresources is not sufficiently liquid, the swap data repository may take \\ninto account a committed line of credit or similar facility for the \\npurpose of meeting this requirement.\\n    (f) Reporting requirements. (1) Each fiscal quarter, or at any time \\nupon Commission request, a registered swap data repository shall report \\nto the Commission the amount of financial resources necessary to meet \\nthe requirements of paragraph (a), the value of each financial resource \\navailable, computed in accordance with the requirements of paragraph \\n(d); and provide the Commission with a financial statement, including \\nthe balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows of the \\nswap data repository or of its parent company.

When this \\nrule is fully implemented, all swaps--whether cleared or uncleared--\\nwill be reported to an SDR registered with the Commodity Futures \\nTrading Commission (CFTC). Registration will enable the Commission \\nand other regulators to monitor market participants for compliance \\nwith the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \\nas well as CFTC regulations. The rule implements congressional \\ndirection that the Commission and other regulators have direct \\naccess to the information maintained by SDRs. It requires SDRs to \\nverify the accuracy and completeness of all of the swaps data they \\naccept. It also contains provisions to permit SDRs to aggregate \\ncertain information for regulators and the public. This rule will \\nenhance transparency in the swaps market and help reduce systemic \\nrisk.\\n\\n[FR Doc. 2011-20817 Filed 8-31-11; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 6351-01-C\\n\\n\\n</pre></body>\\n</html>'"

    "Note: Regulations.gov is AMAZINGLY inconsistent in their encoding of HTML for the full text with lots of little exceptions and variations in format for the .htm document.  Thus, there are a large number of small fixes in the function to handle these cases.  Each follows a pattern rather than simply a single hard-code fix, but be careful changing anything without lots of testing to make sure that there are consisten results.  The code was originally debugged with documentId = CFTC-2013-0056-0001.  It works correctly.  Any changes need to not break the parsing of that document"
