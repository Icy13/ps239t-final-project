 ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 518|| hedging needs increase. If a bona fide hedger seeks an exemption for anticipated commercial production or anticipatory commercial requirements, then the hedger would submit a 404A filing pursuant to Sec.  151.5(c).    Under the Proposed Rules, 404 and 404S filings would have been required on a daily basis. In light of comments concerning the burden of daily filings to both market participants and the Commission, the final regulations require only monthly reporting of 404 and 404S filings. These monthly reports would provide information on daily positions for the month reporting period.    The Commission estimated in the Proposed Rules that these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements would affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $37.6 million across all of these entities, 168,000 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $13.2 million in annual labor costs and $25.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. As a result of modifications made to the Proposed Rules, under the final regulations these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements will affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $28.6 million across all of these entities, 29,700 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $2.3 million in annual labor costs and $26.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404 filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404 filing requirements would affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404 filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404A filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404A filing requirements would affect approximately sixty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 6,000 total annual labor hours and $4.2 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In addition to adjustments in these estimates stemming from the change in the frequency of filings, the estimate of entities affected by 404A filing requirements has been modified to reflect the fact that the final regulations include certain anticipatory hedging exemptions that were absent from the Proposed Rules. Thus, under the final regulations, 404A filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 2,700 total annual labor hours and $6.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404S filings, under the Proposed Rules the Commission estimated that 404S filing requirements would affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 54,000 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404S filing requirements will affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,200 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Section 151.5(e) specifies recordkeeping requirements for traders who claim bona fide hedge exemptions. These recordkeeping requirements include complete books and records concerning all of their related cash, futures, and swap positions and transactions and make such books and records, along with a list of swap counterparties to the Commission. Regulations 151.5(g) and 151.5(h) provide procedural documentation requirements for those availing themselves of a bona fide hedging transaction exemption. These firms would be required to document a representation and confirmation by at least one party that the swap counterparty is relying on a bona fide hedge exemption, along with a confirmation of receipt by the other party to the swap. Paragraph (h) of Sec.  151.5 also requires that the written representation and confirmation be retained by the parties and available to the Commission upon request.\519

 ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 519||     Section 151.6 requires traders with positions exceeding visibility levels in Referenced Contracts in metal and energy commodities to submit additional information about cash market and derivatives activity in substantially the same commodity. Section 151.6(b) requires the submission of a 401 filing which would provide basic position information on the position exceeding the visibility level. Section151.6(c) requires additional information, through a 402S filing, on a trader's uncleared swaps in substantially the same commodity. The Commission has determined to increase the visibility levels from the proposed levels, meaning fewer market participants will be affected by the relevant reporting requirements. In addition, the Proposed Rules included a requirement to submit 404A filings under proposed Sec.  151.6, but the Commission has eliminated this requirement in order to reduce the compliance burden for firms reporting under Sec.  151.6.    Requirements under 401 filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately one hundred forty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,800 total annual labor hours and $15.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, these requirements will affect approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 8,400 total annual labor hours and $5.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Requirements under 402S filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 5,600 total annual labor hours and $4.9 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, the Commission has eliminated the 402S filing, thus eliminating any burden stemming from such reports.

 ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 175||     With respect to the reduction of the timeframe in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) for an FCM to incur a capital charge for undermargined customer accounts, the Commission has considered the comments and has determined to adopt the amendments as proposed. The timely collection of margin is a critical component of an FCM's risk management program and is intended to ensure that an FCM holds sufficient funds deposited by customers to meet their potential obligations to a DCO. As guarantor of the financial performance of the customer accounts that it carries, the FCM is financially responsible if the owner of an account cannot meet its margin obligations to the FCM and ultimately to a DCO.    The timeframe for meeting margin calls currently provided in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) was established in the 1970s when the use of checks and the mail system were more prevalent for depositing margin with an FCM. However, in today's markets, with the increasing use of technology, 24-hour-a-day trading, and the use of wire transfers to meet margin obligations, the Commission believes that the timeframe for taking a capital charge should be reduced both to give an incentive to FCMs to exercise prudent risk management and to strengthen the financial protections of FCMs, and to enhance the safety of the clearing systems and other customers by requiring FCMs to reserve capital for undermargined customer accounts that fail to meet a margin call on a timely basis.    Several commenters have stated that the proposal would harm customers by increasing costs to customers or by exposing more of the customers' funds to the FCM.\176
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 176|| proposed. As noted above, Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(ix) applies to noncustomers and omnibus accounts carried by an FCM. Many of the concerns raised by the comments regarding the ability to fund a margin call under Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) do not apply to accounts held by an affiliate or an omnibus accounts. Such accounts should pay margin calls promptly and by wire transfer to reduce the potential exposure to the FCM resulting from undermargined accounts.    The Commission also believes that the amendments to Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) and (ix) are appropriate even if the Commission amends its regulations to require an FCM to maintain residual interest in segregated accounts in excess of the undermargined amount of customer accounts. The purpose of the capital rule is to ensure that an FCM maintains sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations as a going concern. Proprietary funds held in segregated accounts that exceed the total obligation to customers are included in an FCM's capital computation. However, in situations where the FCM's residual interest in segregated accounts is covering an undermargined customer account, a capital charge is appropriate because the FCM's residual interest is necessary to cover potential market losses on the undermargined accounts.3. Permit an FCM That Is Not a BD To Develop Policies and Procedures To Determine Creditworthiness    The Commissions proposed to amend Sec.  1.17(c)(v) to permit an FCM that is not a BD to develop a framework to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures for determining creditworthiness of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable. In recommending the proposal, the Commission noted that the SEC proposed to permit a BD to establish written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable.\177
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ### ERROR CHUNK ###, index: 177||     Under both the Commission's proposal and the SEC's proposal, an FCM or BD would assess the security's credit risk using the following factors, to the extent appropriate:    <bullet> Credit spreads (i.e., whether it is possible to demonstrate that a position in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock is subject to a minimal amount of credit risk based on the spread between the security's yield and the yield of Treasury or other securities, or based on credit default swap spreads that reference the security);    <bullet> Securities-related research (i.e., whether providers of securities-related research believe the issuer of the security will be able to meet its financial commitments, generally, or specifically, with respect to securities held by the FCM or BD);    <bullet> Internal or external credit risk assessments (i.e., whether credit assessments developed internally by the FCM or BD or externally by a credit rating agency, irrespective of its status as an NRSRO, express a view as to the credit risk associated with a particular security);    <bullet> Default statistics (i.e., whether providers of credit information relating to securities express a view that specific securities have a probability of default consistent with other securities with a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Inclusion on an index (i.e., whether a security, or issuer of the security, is included as a component of a recognized index of instruments that are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Priorities and enhancements (i.e., the extent to which a security is covered by credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization and reserve accounts, or has priority under applicable bankruptcy or creditors' rights provisions);    <bullet> Price, yield and/or volume (i.e., whether the price and yield of a security or a credit default swap that references the security are consistent with other securities that the FCM or BD has determined are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk and whether the price resulted from active trading); and    <bullet> Asset class-specific factors (e.g., in the case of structured finance products, the quality of the underlying assets).    An FCM that maintains written policies and procedures and determines that the credit risk of a security is minimal is permitted under the proposal to apply the lesser haircut requirement currently specified in the SEC capital rule for commercial paper (i.e., between zero and \1/2

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ~~# Error Chunk +2, index: 107||     For purposes of the clearing requirement determination, the Commission developed the following class definitions based on information provided by the submitting DCOs and market conventions.    1. ``Fixed-to-floating swap'': A swap in which the payment or payments owed for one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the payment or payments owed for the other leg are calculated using a floating rate.    2. ``Floating-to-floating swap'' or ``basis swap'': A swap in which the payments for both legs are calculated using floating rates.    3. ``Forward Rate Agreement'' or ``FRA'': A swap in which payments are exchanged on a pre-determined date for a single specified period and one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate that is set on a pre-determined date.    4. ``Overnight indexed swap'' or ``OIS'': A swap for which one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate based on a daily overnight rate.    As described in the NPRM, the LCH and CME IRS submissions addressed issues of classification for purposes of the interest rate swap clearing requirement. In its submission, LCH discussed the classification of interest rate swaps and recommended establishing clearing requirements for classes of interest rate swaps. In effect, LCH recommended the use of a set of basic product specifications to identify and describe each class of swaps subject to the clearing requirement. CME recommended a clearing determination for all non-option interest rate swaps denominated in a currency cleared by any qualified DCO.    As an alternative, the Commission considered whether to establish clearing requirements on a product-by-product basis. The Commission noted in the NPRM that such a determination would need to identify the multitude of specifications of each product that would be subject to the clearing requirement. In this regard, LCH stated in its IRS submission that the clearing requirement ``would be sub-optimal for the overall market if participants are forced to read pages of rules to decipher whether or not a swap is required to be cleared, or to have to make complex and time consuming decisions at the point of execution.'' \106

 ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 518|| hedging needs increase. If a bona fide hedger seeks an exemption for anticipated commercial production or anticipatory commercial requirements, then the hedger would submit a 404A filing pursuant to Sec.  151.5(c).    Under the Proposed Rules, 404 and 404S filings would have been required on a daily basis. In light of comments concerning the burden of daily filings to both market participants and the Commission, the final regulations require only monthly reporting of 404 and 404S filings. These monthly reports would provide information on daily positions for the month reporting period.    The Commission estimated in the Proposed Rules that these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements would affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $37.6 million across all of these entities, 168,000 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $13.2 million in annual labor costs and $25.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. As a result of modifications made to the Proposed Rules, under the final regulations these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements will affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $28.6 million across all of these entities, 29,700 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $2.3 million in annual labor costs and $26.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404 filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404 filing requirements would affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404 filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404A filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404A filing requirements would affect approximately sixty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 6,000 total annual labor hours and $4.2 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In addition to adjustments in these estimates stemming from the change in the frequency of filings, the estimate of entities affected by 404A filing requirements has been modified to reflect the fact that the final regulations include certain anticipatory hedging exemptions that were absent from the Proposed Rules. Thus, under the final regulations, 404A filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 2,700 total annual labor hours and $6.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404S filings, under the Proposed Rules the Commission estimated that 404S filing requirements would affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 54,000 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404S filing requirements will affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,200 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Section 151.5(e) specifies recordkeeping requirements for traders who claim bona fide hedge exemptions. These recordkeeping requirements include complete books and records concerning all of their related cash, futures, and swap positions and transactions and make such books and records, along with a list of swap counterparties to the Commission. Regulations 151.5(g) and 151.5(h) provide procedural documentation requirements for those availing themselves of a bona fide hedging transaction exemption. These firms would be required to document a representation and confirmation by at least one party that the swap counterparty is relying on a bona fide hedge exemption, along with a confirmation of receipt by the other party to the swap. Paragraph (h) of Sec.  151.5 also requires that the written representation and confirmation be retained by the parties and available to the Commission upon request.\519

 ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 519||     Section 151.6 requires traders with positions exceeding visibility levels in Referenced Contracts in metal and energy commodities to submit additional information about cash market and derivatives activity in substantially the same commodity. Section 151.6(b) requires the submission of a 401 filing which would provide basic position information on the position exceeding the visibility level. Section151.6(c) requires additional information, through a 402S filing, on a trader's uncleared swaps in substantially the same commodity. The Commission has determined to increase the visibility levels from the proposed levels, meaning fewer market participants will be affected by the relevant reporting requirements. In addition, the Proposed Rules included a requirement to submit 404A filings under proposed Sec.  151.6, but the Commission has eliminated this requirement in order to reduce the compliance burden for firms reporting under Sec.  151.6.    Requirements under 401 filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately one hundred forty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,800 total annual labor hours and $15.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, these requirements will affect approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 8,400 total annual labor hours and $5.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Requirements under 402S filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 5,600 total annual labor hours and $4.9 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, the Commission has eliminated the 402S filing, thus eliminating any burden stemming from such reports.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ~~# Error Chunk +2, index: 107||     For purposes of the clearing requirement determination, the Commission developed the following class definitions based on information provided by the submitting DCOs and market conventions.    1. ``Fixed-to-floating swap'': A swap in which the payment or payments owed for one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the payment or payments owed for the other leg are calculated using a floating rate.    2. ``Floating-to-floating swap'' or ``basis swap'': A swap in which the payments for both legs are calculated using floating rates.    3. ``Forward Rate Agreement'' or ``FRA'': A swap in which payments are exchanged on a pre-determined date for a single specified period and one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate that is set on a pre-determined date.    4. ``Overnight indexed swap'' or ``OIS'': A swap for which one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate based on a daily overnight rate.    As described in the NPRM, the LCH and CME IRS submissions addressed issues of classification for purposes of the interest rate swap clearing requirement. In its submission, LCH discussed the classification of interest rate swaps and recommended establishing clearing requirements for classes of interest rate swaps. In effect, LCH recommended the use of a set of basic product specifications to identify and describe each class of swaps subject to the clearing requirement. CME recommended a clearing determination for all non-option interest rate swaps denominated in a currency cleared by any qualified DCO.    As an alternative, the Commission considered whether to establish clearing requirements on a product-by-product basis. The Commission noted in the NPRM that such a determination would need to identify the multitude of specifications of each product that would be subject to the clearing requirement. In this regard, LCH stated in its IRS submission that the clearing requirement ``would be sub-optimal for the overall market if participants are forced to read pages of rules to decipher whether or not a swap is required to be cleared, or to have to make complex and time consuming decisions at the point of execution.'' \106

 ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 175||     With respect to the reduction of the timeframe in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) for an FCM to incur a capital charge for undermargined customer accounts, the Commission has considered the comments and has determined to adopt the amendments as proposed. The timely collection of margin is a critical component of an FCM's risk management program and is intended to ensure that an FCM holds sufficient funds deposited by customers to meet their potential obligations to a DCO. As guarantor of the financial performance of the customer accounts that it carries, the FCM is financially responsible if the owner of an account cannot meet its margin obligations to the FCM and ultimately to a DCO.    The timeframe for meeting margin calls currently provided in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) was established in the 1970s when the use of checks and the mail system were more prevalent for depositing margin with an FCM. However, in today's markets, with the increasing use of technology, 24-hour-a-day trading, and the use of wire transfers to meet margin obligations, the Commission believes that the timeframe for taking a capital charge should be reduced both to give an incentive to FCMs to exercise prudent risk management and to strengthen the financial protections of FCMs, and to enhance the safety of the clearing systems and other customers by requiring FCMs to reserve capital for undermargined customer accounts that fail to meet a margin call on a timely basis.    Several commenters have stated that the proposal would harm customers by increasing costs to customers or by exposing more of the customers' funds to the FCM.\176
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 176|| proposed. As noted above, Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(ix) applies to noncustomers and omnibus accounts carried by an FCM. Many of the concerns raised by the comments regarding the ability to fund a margin call under Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) do not apply to accounts held by an affiliate or an omnibus accounts. Such accounts should pay margin calls promptly and by wire transfer to reduce the potential exposure to the FCM resulting from undermargined accounts.    The Commission also believes that the amendments to Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) and (ix) are appropriate even if the Commission amends its regulations to require an FCM to maintain residual interest in segregated accounts in excess of the undermargined amount of customer accounts. The purpose of the capital rule is to ensure that an FCM maintains sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations as a going concern. Proprietary funds held in segregated accounts that exceed the total obligation to customers are included in an FCM's capital computation. However, in situations where the FCM's residual interest in segregated accounts is covering an undermargined customer account, a capital charge is appropriate because the FCM's residual interest is necessary to cover potential market losses on the undermargined accounts.3. Permit an FCM That Is Not a BD To Develop Policies and Procedures To Determine Creditworthiness    The Commissions proposed to amend Sec.  1.17(c)(v) to permit an FCM that is not a BD to develop a framework to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures for determining creditworthiness of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable. In recommending the proposal, the Commission noted that the SEC proposed to permit a BD to establish written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable.\177
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ### ERROR CHUNK ###, index: 177||     Under both the Commission's proposal and the SEC's proposal, an FCM or BD would assess the security's credit risk using the following factors, to the extent appropriate:    <bullet> Credit spreads (i.e., whether it is possible to demonstrate that a position in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock is subject to a minimal amount of credit risk based on the spread between the security's yield and the yield of Treasury or other securities, or based on credit default swap spreads that reference the security);    <bullet> Securities-related research (i.e., whether providers of securities-related research believe the issuer of the security will be able to meet its financial commitments, generally, or specifically, with respect to securities held by the FCM or BD);    <bullet> Internal or external credit risk assessments (i.e., whether credit assessments developed internally by the FCM or BD or externally by a credit rating agency, irrespective of its status as an NRSRO, express a view as to the credit risk associated with a particular security);    <bullet> Default statistics (i.e., whether providers of credit information relating to securities express a view that specific securities have a probability of default consistent with other securities with a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Inclusion on an index (i.e., whether a security, or issuer of the security, is included as a component of a recognized index of instruments that are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Priorities and enhancements (i.e., the extent to which a security is covered by credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization and reserve accounts, or has priority under applicable bankruptcy or creditors' rights provisions);    <bullet> Price, yield and/or volume (i.e., whether the price and yield of a security or a credit default swap that references the security are consistent with other securities that the FCM or BD has determined are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk and whether the price resulted from active trading); and    <bullet> Asset class-specific factors (e.g., in the case of structured finance products, the quality of the underlying assets).    An FCM that maintains written policies and procedures and determines that the credit risk of a security is minimal is permitted under the proposal to apply the lesser haircut requirement currently specified in the SEC capital rule for commercial paper (i.e., between zero and \1/2

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ~~# Error Chunk +2, index: 107||     For purposes of the clearing requirement determination, the Commission developed the following class definitions based on information provided by the submitting DCOs and market conventions.    1. ``Fixed-to-floating swap'': A swap in which the payment or payments owed for one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the payment or payments owed for the other leg are calculated using a floating rate.    2. ``Floating-to-floating swap'' or ``basis swap'': A swap in which the payments for both legs are calculated using floating rates.    3. ``Forward Rate Agreement'' or ``FRA'': A swap in which payments are exchanged on a pre-determined date for a single specified period and one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate that is set on a pre-determined date.    4. ``Overnight indexed swap'' or ``OIS'': A swap for which one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate based on a daily overnight rate.    As described in the NPRM, the LCH and CME IRS submissions addressed issues of classification for purposes of the interest rate swap clearing requirement. In its submission, LCH discussed the classification of interest rate swaps and recommended establishing clearing requirements for classes of interest rate swaps. In effect, LCH recommended the use of a set of basic product specifications to identify and describe each class of swaps subject to the clearing requirement. CME recommended a clearing determination for all non-option interest rate swaps denominated in a currency cleared by any qualified DCO.    As an alternative, the Commission considered whether to establish clearing requirements on a product-by-product basis. The Commission noted in the NPRM that such a determination would need to identify the multitude of specifications of each product that would be subject to the clearing requirement. In this regard, LCH stated in its IRS submission that the clearing requirement ``would be sub-optimal for the overall market if participants are forced to read pages of rules to decipher whether or not a swap is required to be cleared, or to have to make complex and time consuming decisions at the point of execution.'' \106

 ~~# Error Chunk +2, index: 107||     For purposes of the clearing requirement determination, the Commission developed the following class definitions based on information provided by the submitting DCOs and market conventions.    1. ``Fixed-to-floating swap'': A swap in which the payment or payments owed for one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the payment or payments owed for the other leg are calculated using a floating rate.    2. ``Floating-to-floating swap'' or ``basis swap'': A swap in which the payments for both legs are calculated using floating rates.    3. ``Forward Rate Agreement'' or ``FRA'': A swap in which payments are exchanged on a pre-determined date for a single specified period and one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate that is set on a pre-determined date.    4. ``Overnight indexed swap'' or ``OIS'': A swap for which one leg of the swap is calculated using a fixed rate and the other leg is calculated using a floating rate based on a daily overnight rate.    As described in the NPRM, the LCH and CME IRS submissions addressed issues of classification for purposes of the interest rate swap clearing requirement. In its submission, LCH discussed the classification of interest rate swaps and recommended establishing clearing requirements for classes of interest rate swaps. In effect, LCH recommended the use of a set of basic product specifications to identify and describe each class of swaps subject to the clearing requirement. CME recommended a clearing determination for all non-option interest rate swaps denominated in a currency cleared by any qualified DCO.    As an alternative, the Commission considered whether to establish clearing requirements on a product-by-product basis. The Commission noted in the NPRM that such a determination would need to identify the multitude of specifications of each product that would be subject to the clearing requirement. In this regard, LCH stated in its IRS submission that the clearing requirement ``would be sub-optimal for the overall market if participants are forced to read pages of rules to decipher whether or not a swap is required to be cleared, or to have to make complex and time consuming decisions at the point of execution.'' \106

 ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 518|| hedging needs increase. If a bona fide hedger seeks an exemption for anticipated commercial production or anticipatory commercial requirements, then the hedger would submit a 404A filing pursuant to Sec.  151.5(c).    Under the Proposed Rules, 404 and 404S filings would have been required on a daily basis. In light of comments concerning the burden of daily filings to both market participants and the Commission, the final regulations require only monthly reporting of 404 and 404S filings. These monthly reports would provide information on daily positions for the month reporting period.    The Commission estimated in the Proposed Rules that these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements would affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $37.6 million across all of these entities, 168,000 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $13.2 million in annual labor costs and $25.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. As a result of modifications made to the Proposed Rules, under the final regulations these bona fide hedging-related reporting requirements will affect approximately two hundred entities annually and result in a total burden of approximately $28.6 million across all of these entities, 29,700 annual labor hours, resulting in a total of $2.3 million in annual labor costs and $26.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404 filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404 filing requirements would affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404 filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 108,000 total annual labor hours and $11.7 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404A filings, under the Proposed Rules, the Commission estimated that 404A filing requirements would affect approximately sixty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 6,000 total annual labor hours and $4.2 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In addition to adjustments in these estimates stemming from the change in the frequency of filings, the estimate of entities affected by 404A filing requirements has been modified to reflect the fact that the final regulations include certain anticipatory hedging exemptions that were absent from the Proposed Rules. Thus, under the final regulations, 404A filing requirements will affect approximately ninety entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 2,700 total annual labor hours and $6.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    With regard to 404S filings, under the Proposed Rules the Commission estimated that 404S filing requirements would affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 54,000 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. Under the final regulations, 404S filing requirements will affect approximately forty-five entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,200 total annual labor hours and $9.5 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Section 151.5(e) specifies recordkeeping requirements for traders who claim bona fide hedge exemptions. These recordkeeping requirements include complete books and records concerning all of their related cash, futures, and swap positions and transactions and make such books and records, along with a list of swap counterparties to the Commission. Regulations 151.5(g) and 151.5(h) provide procedural documentation requirements for those availing themselves of a bona fide hedging transaction exemption. These firms would be required to document a representation and confirmation by at least one party that the swap counterparty is relying on a bona fide hedge exemption, along with a confirmation of receipt by the other party to the swap. Paragraph (h) of Sec.  151.5 also requires that the written representation and confirmation be retained by the parties and available to the Commission upon request.\519

 ~~# Error Chunk -1, index: 519||     Section 151.6 requires traders with positions exceeding visibility levels in Referenced Contracts in metal and energy commodities to submit additional information about cash market and derivatives activity in substantially the same commodity. Section 151.6(b) requires the submission of a 401 filing which would provide basic position information on the position exceeding the visibility level. Section151.6(c) requires additional information, through a 402S filing, on a trader's uncleared swaps in substantially the same commodity. The Commission has determined to increase the visibility levels from the proposed levels, meaning fewer market participants will be affected by the relevant reporting requirements. In addition, the Proposed Rules included a requirement to submit 404A filings under proposed Sec.  151.6, but the Commission has eliminated this requirement in order to reduce the compliance burden for firms reporting under Sec.  151.6.    Requirements under 401 filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately one hundred forty entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 16,800 total annual labor hours and $15.4 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, these requirements will affect approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 8,400 total annual labor hours and $5.3 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs.    Requirements under 402S filing reporting regulations in the Proposed Rules would have affected approximately seventy entities annually, resulting in a total burden, across all of these entities, of 5,600 total annual labor hours and $4.9 million in annualized capital, start-up, total operating, and maintenance costs. In the final regulations, the Commission has eliminated the 402S filing, thus eliminating any burden stemming from such reports.

 ~~# Error Chunk -2, index: 175||     With respect to the reduction of the timeframe in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) for an FCM to incur a capital charge for undermargined customer accounts, the Commission has considered the comments and has determined to adopt the amendments as proposed. The timely collection of margin is a critical component of an FCM's risk management program and is intended to ensure that an FCM holds sufficient funds deposited by customers to meet their potential obligations to a DCO. As guarantor of the financial performance of the customer accounts that it carries, the FCM is financially responsible if the owner of an account cannot meet its margin obligations to the FCM and ultimately to a DCO.    The timeframe for meeting margin calls currently provided in Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) was established in the 1970s when the use of checks and the mail system were more prevalent for depositing margin with an FCM. However, in today's markets, with the increasing use of technology, 24-hour-a-day trading, and the use of wire transfers to meet margin obligations, the Commission believes that the timeframe for taking a capital charge should be reduced both to give an incentive to FCMs to exercise prudent risk management and to strengthen the financial protections of FCMs, and to enhance the safety of the clearing systems and other customers by requiring FCMs to reserve capital for undermargined customer accounts that fail to meet a margin call on a timely basis.    Several commenters have stated that the proposal would harm customers by increasing costs to customers or by exposing more of the customers' funds to the FCM.\176

Many of the concerns raised by the comments regarding the ability to fund a margin call under Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) do not apply to accounts held by an affiliate or an omnibus accounts. Such accounts should pay margin calls promptly and by wire transfer to reduce the potential exposure to the FCM resulting from undermargined accounts.    The Commission also believes that the amendments to Sec.  1.17(c)(5)(viii) and (ix) are appropriate even if the Commission amends its regulations to require an FCM to maintain residual interest in segregated accounts in excess of the undermargined amount of customer accounts. The purpose of the capital rule is to ensure that an FCM maintains sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations as a going concern. Proprietary funds held in segregated accounts that exceed the total obligation to customers are included in an FCM's capital computation. However, in situations where the FCM's residual interest in segregated accounts is covering an undermargined customer account, a capital charge is appropriate because the FCM's residual interest is necessary to cover potential market losses on the undermargined accounts.3. Permit an FCM That Is Not a BD To Develop Policies and Procedures To Determine Creditworthiness    The Commissions proposed to amend Sec.  1.17(c)(v) to permit an FCM that is not a BD to develop a framework to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures for determining creditworthiness of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable. In recommending the proposal, the Commission noted that the SEC proposed to permit a BD to establish written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt, and nonconvertible debt instruments that are readily marketable.\177

 ### ERROR CHUNK ###, index: 177||     Under both the Commission's proposal and the SEC's proposal, an FCM or BD would assess the security's credit risk using the following factors, to the extent appropriate:    <bullet> Credit spreads (i.e., whether it is possible to demonstrate that a position in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock is subject to a minimal amount of credit risk based on the spread between the security's yield and the yield of Treasury or other securities, or based on credit default swap spreads that reference the security);    <bullet> Securities-related research (i.e., whether providers of securities-related research believe the issuer of the security will be able to meet its financial commitments, generally, or specifically, with respect to securities held by the FCM or BD);    <bullet> Internal or external credit risk assessments (i.e., whether credit assessments developed internally by the FCM or BD or externally by a credit rating agency, irrespective of its status as an NRSRO, express a view as to the credit risk associated with a particular security);    <bullet> Default statistics (i.e., whether providers of credit information relating to securities express a view that specific securities have a probability of default consistent with other securities with a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Inclusion on an index (i.e., whether a security, or issuer of the security, is included as a component of a recognized index of instruments that are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk);    <bullet> Priorities and enhancements (i.e., the extent to which a security is covered by credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization and reserve accounts, or has priority under applicable bankruptcy or creditors' rights provisions);    <bullet> Price, yield and/or volume (i.e., whether the price and yield of a security or a credit default swap that references the security are consistent with other securities that the FCM or BD has determined are subject to a minimal amount of credit risk and whether the price resulted from active trading); and    <bullet> Asset class-specific factors (e.g., in the case of structured finance products, the quality of the underlying assets).    An FCM that maintains written policies and procedures and determines that the credit risk of a security is minimal is permitted under the proposal to apply the lesser haircut requirement currently specified in the SEC capital rule for commercial paper (i.e., between zero and \1/2
